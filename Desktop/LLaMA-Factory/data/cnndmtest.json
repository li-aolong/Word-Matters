In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy. Sporting a navy blue suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne squirmed in his seat as England got off to a difficult start, despite an early try. Scroll down for video . Stress: The Prince can barely watch as England beat France 55-35 but narrowly missed out on the Six Nations . Taking its toll: Harry looks anxious as England struggled to cope with France's impressive start to the match . Passion: Prince Harry belts out the national anthem, seated behind England coach Stuart Lancaster . Despite their herculean effort, England could not find a final try and finished second in the championship, behind Ireland. After the match, England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for 'one of the most courageous performances' he has seen from his side. 'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed\u00a040-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20. All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey . Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game. Harry - who is a Vice Patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) - also chatted with members of the armed forces at Twickenham .

A dreadful start to the campaign saw them slip to 10th, seven points off the minimum requirement of a top-four place, in mid-December and exit the Champions League at the group stage. Since then, however, they have taken 30 points from their 12 subsequent Premier League matches to put themselves firmly in the mix for a top-four place and have an FA Cup quarter-final replay against Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn to face next month. Joe Allen (centre) warms up with SImon Mignolet and Lazar Markovic (right) last week . Allen (left) trains with team-mate Steven Gerrard and right back Glen Johnson (centre) 'We always knew we'd turn it around but we wondered how long it was going to take. It did take longer than we expected, I think,' said Wales midfielder Allen. 'Losing Luis Suarez in the summer (to Barcelona) and Daniel Sturridge being out (injured) for so long as well and the change we had, we always knew there'd be a little bit of a rocky patch but we didn't expect it to go on so long. 'We put expectation on ourselves because we think we're good enough to go on runs like this. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is trying to tie down a number of his first-team stars to longer deals . Emre Can and Kolo Toure (right) battle each other as they go for a sprint during training . 'With the players we've got, and the confidence we're playing with, I think it's a case of long may it continue.' The turnaround came after their Champions League failure was followed immediately by a 3-0 defeat at Manchester United, their main rival for a top-four spot. A change in system to a 3-4-2-1 formation has brought the best out of a number of players, particularly 22-year-old playmaker Philippe Coutinho and utility man Emre Can, who recently turned 21.

Martin Skrtel works on his fitness and conditioning with Liverpool coach Ryland Morgans (left) 'People forget sometimes that we're a pretty young team and squad,' Allen, who is fit again after a hip problem to face former club Swansea this evening, told liverpoolfc.com. 'The beauty of that is that we will get better. We've shown that as the season has gone on. 'With this run of games we're going on, we're really looking forward to Monday night's game and we'll be setting our stall out to go there and pick up three points. 'We've grown massively and I think you can see the change in formation. We've taken to that really well and quickly, which is important. 'I think we seem to have that edge back, even if we're not playing the most flowing football or things aren't going 100 per cent to plan, we still look like we're going to get the result and I think that speaks volumes about how much everyone has taken things forward.' Manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to keep the nucleus of this young side together, and while contract negotiations with Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson have dragged on for several months now they have just opened talks with the 24-year-old Allen over a new deal. 'We're at the early stages at the moment but the signs are good,' he told BBC Wales Sport. 'From my point of view I'm looking to commit my future here and hopefully I can be here for years to come. 'For me it's just a case of playing regularly and putting in consistent performances. I've always been confident that I'll be able to be successful here.' CHELSEA . Hull (away) - March 22 .

The court appointed accountants Angelo Anedda and Alberto Guiotto as receivers. 'I believe we'll play on Sunday against Torino,' board member Osvaldo Riccobene told reporters at the end of the hearing. Parma's players and staff haven't been paid in months, with players having to do their own laundry and drive the team bus while games were postponed because the club could not afford stewards or police at their Tardini stadium.

        "input": "AIDS came from gorillas as well as chimpanzees, new research\u00a0suggests. Two of the four known groups of viruses that cause the disease have been traced back to the great apes that share about 98 per cent of their DNA with humans. It had been known simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) - the monkey equivalent of HIV - had jumped from chimpanzees into humans, but now it seems gorillas in Cameroon also played a vital role. Scientists say understanding the disease's origins will help predict the future risk of an outbreak. Scientists have discovered that AIDS may have originated from western lowland gorillas in Cameroon, as well as groups of chimpanzees in the country . The connection was uncovered after researchers analysed faecal samples collected in remote forests. They found HIV-1 groups known as 'O' and 'P' originated in western lowland gorillas. HIV-1 - the virus that causes AIDS - has jumped species to infect humans on at least four separate occasions. The other lineages, 'M' and 'N', are known to have started in geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon. Group 'M' gave rise to the AIDS pandemic - infecting over 40 million people worldwide by spreading across Africa and throughout the rest of the world. Scientists found HIV-1 groups known as 'O' and 'P' originated in western lowland gorillas. A conceptual image of a HIV infected cell is pictured . Groups 'N' and 'P', at the other extreme, have only been found in a few individuals from Cameroon. But 'O' - although not as widespread and prevalent as 'M' - has nonetheless infected about 100,000 people in west central Africa. The team screened fecal samples from western lowland gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas, and mountain gorillas in Cameroon, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda for evidence of SIV strains - the pre-cursors of HIV. A new book claims the AIDS epidemic began in a rainforest in southeastern Cameroon in 1908 and not more than 70 years later when the virus started to be recognized in the early 1980s. For the book, which is subtitled 'How AIDS emerged from an African forest', David Quammen traced the history of AIDS by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps. This led him to believe the birthplace of the epidemic was the southeastern edge of Cameroon sometime around 1908. Quammen theorizes that a hunter in the rainforest was infected with a immunodeficiency virus similar to HIV by a chimp he killed and butchered. The hunter likely infected at least one other person through sex and the virus continued to make its way down the Sangha River in that matter until it reached the city of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in the Congo. After reaching the Congo, the virus spread even faster via the continued re-use of hypodermic syringes at health clinics, Mr Quammen said. They identified it in four communities of western lowland gorillas in southern Cameroon - and dubbed it 'SIVgor'. Professor Beatrice Hahn, of Pennsylvania University, said: 'Viral sequencing revealed a high degree of genetic diversity among the different gorilla samples. 'Two of the gorilla virus lineages were particularly closely related to HIV-1 groups O and P. This told us these two groups originated in western lowland gorillas.' Dr Martine Peeters, of Montpelier University in France, said the study has implications for understanding emerging diseases and gauging future human infection risks. She added: 'From this study and others our team has conducted in the past it has become clear both chimpanzees and gorillas harbour viruses capable of crossing the species barrier to humans and have the potential to cause major disease outbreaks.' The origin of HIV has baffled scientists since 1984 when it was first shown it causes AIDS. Evidence soon pointed to Africa and a similar virus in chimpanzees. Many scientists suspect that the chimp virus jumped into humans who hunt and butcher these great apes. But gorillas are now emerging as having played a supporting role in the AIDS epidemic - possibly by humans hunting them. The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n",

Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .\n",

When police arrived at the home (pictured) early on Sunday, they found Barnes and the girl in a bedroom . After\u00a0Silvonek was dead, Barnes and the daughter, who was in the car during the killing, took the other family vehicle to Wamart and purchased\u00a0alcohol, bleach and other cleaning products, the Allentown Morning Call\u00a0reported. They attempted to clean up the car, drove it to nearby\u00a0South Whitehall and buried\u00a0Silvonek in a shallow grave.

The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep,CBS 13\u00a0reported. Barnes, who has the rank of specialist, was charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. She has been charged with\u00a0abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. It has not been determined if she will be tried as an adult or a juvenile. Defense attorney John Waldron said: 'She's just crying for her mom, saying she misses her mom. 'This is a child, who just turned 14. She's in shock.' The girl's grandparents were in the courtroom during a hearing on Monday. Waldron said: 'Everyone was crying. It was just brutal.' Barnes and the girl started dating in October. He joined the military in February of 2012. He graduated advanced training from the Presidio of Monterey, California, and his awards include the Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal, Army Times reported. David Silvonek said he was not aware of their relationship. Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said. 'The mother became aware of the relationship and was attempting to have her daughter break it off. 'Obviously we don't know what occurred in the driveway. There are different versions of the event.' The girl is in a juvenile facility that will provide her with psychological counseling. A friend of Barnes said he had personal problems, 69 News\u00a0reported.

Elizabeth Rachel Dove, 23, of Oregon struck the three girls in January from Centennial High School with her white Kia, and at the time was recording a 19-second video of her son who was sat in the backseat, according to police. The young mother has been indicted on several charges including\u00a0five counts of recklessly endangering, three counts of third-degree assault and one count of reckless driving, according to KATU. Elizabeth Rachel Dove (above), 23, of Oregon struck the three girls in January from Centennial High School with her white Kia, and at the time was recording a 19-second video of her son who was sat in the backseat, according to police . Investigators found that Dove had used her phone immediately prior to the crash on January 15 when freshman Sarah Hollenbeck, 15, and her two unidentified friends, both 14, were leaving an after-school program (above scenes from the January crash as the girls lie in the street after being struck as students rush to help them) Investigators found that Dove had used her phone immediately prior to the crash on January 15 when freshman Sarah Hollenbeck, 15, and her two unidentified friends, both 14, were leaving an after-school program. They were hit just outside of the high school in Gresham. Following the crash, the three girls were taken to hospital where they were treated for injuries, and were later released, according to KPTV. A status report from January revealed one teen girl suffered from a concussion and torn ACL, and the bone on her left knee was torn out; the second teen was left with a broken nose, a major concussion, bruises to her legs, feet and face, unable to walk due to pain in her ankle and lost a tooth; and Hollenbeck suffered from a fractured skull, pelvis and knee. In the events leading up to the crash, Dove sent five input messages and received one, as well as had a phone call lasting seven minutes before recording the video, according to phone records included in a court affidavit from the Multnomah County court. In the events leading up to the crash, Dove sent five input messages and received one, as well as had a phone call lasting seven minutes before recording a video (above the girls are tended to by emergency responders) A second video follows shortly after lasting six seconds, which was also recovered showing the phone bouncing on the front passenger seat (above scenes from the crash) During the 19-second video she recorded of her son, she is holding the phone with her left hand and making gestures with her right hand. A second video follows shortly after lasting six seconds, which was also recovered showing the phone bouncing on the front passenger seat. The report notes this is clearly when the crash occurred, as Dove is panicked and her child is heard crying in the background. Police determined that Dove hit the teen girls 1.42 seconds after the video ended, and that they entered the roadway at the time when Dove 'appears to have no hands on the steering wheel'. Lowvy Ma, who witnessed the crash, said he honked his horn when he realized that Dove was going to hit the girls. He said he saw her car slow down for a few seconds before the teens were hit and he saw them 'go flying'. Hollenbeck recalled how she woke up after being struck by the car and saw her two friends lying on the ground next to her, according to an earlier report by KGW. 'It was really scary because I saw both my friends being covered in a blanket and I thought they were dead,' she said. Hollenbeck added:\u00a0'We were so lucky. I think the next time it could be fatal for someone.' Dove got out of the car and waited at the scene until police arrived, and told responding officers she did not see the teens before the crash. She also admitted to phone use. Police determined that Dove hit the teen girls 1.42 seconds after the video ended, and that they entered the roadway at the time when Dove 'appears to have no hands on the steering wheel' (above Dove's damaged white Kia) The young mother has been indicted on several charges including five counts of recklessly endangering, three counts of third-degree assault and one count of reckless driving (above the crosswalk where the incident took place) Dove, who has been convicted previously for theft and ID theft, was arrested on March 4 but was released from jail, and now faces the several charges. There was no alcohol or drugs involved in the incident, according to police. In Oregon, using cellphones while driving is against the law except for in cases when the driver is using a hands-free device and is over the age of 18. Following the crash, the city has installed a rapid-flash beacon at the crosswalk.\n",

Officers met \"complete chaos\" when they tried to find out what happened not long after midnight Friday, Sheriff Frank McKeithen told CNN affiliate WMBB when interviewed on the scene. Video showed the streets teeming with young people. Three people with gunshot wounds were found inside a house, one outside the house, one in the median of the road and two on the other side of the road, the sheriff's office said in a press release. \"We have about 100 witnesses or so that we are trying to separate and interview,\" McKeithen told WMBB. \"We have a mess.\" The scene was so mixed up that deputies from five adjacent counties and officers from the Florida Highway Patrol and Panama City Beach police were called in to assist. The shooting occurred at a residence on Thomas Drive, the main drag in the beach town. Several of the victims were students from Alabama A&M University who were visiting town for spring break, the sheriff's office said. They're between 20 and 22 years of age. During February and March, up to six million young people visit Panama City Beach, which some have been dubbed \"the Spring Break Capital of the World.\" The Panhandle town has a resident population of about 12,000. Some of the young people were shot multiple times. They were taken to area hospitals, where three were listed in critical condition and three in stable condition, the sheriff's office said. The seventh person was in surgery when the press release was issued and no update on his condition was provided. Authorities arrested David Jarmichael Daniels, 22, of Mobile, Alabama, on seven counts of attempted murder. A .40-caliber pistol was found in the backyard of a residence. Officials did not mention a possible motive. The shooting was one of six firearms-related incidents of the night, with four guns seized in drug cases, the sheriff's office said in a press release. Other details were not provided. On Saturday night, the Panama City Beach City Council held a special meeting to talk about the violence. \"It's time to stop the bloodshed,\" said council member Keith Curry, according to WMBB. \"We're lucky that we don't have seven dead people.\" \"This is a hostile takeover, an attempt at a hostile takeover,\" said Sparky Sparkman, owner of Spinnaker Beach Club. \"And if anyone here doesn't think what's going on out there is hostile, just ride up and down the street.\" The council considered banning alcohol on the beach through mid-April, but that measure was voted down, WMBB said. The council approved more funding for extra enforcement on the beach.\n",

The dog's ears had been sliced off and it had also had a stab wound to his head. Cropping ears is sometimes a practice carried out by dog fighters, but it doesn't involve taking the full ear off, as was the case in the stray found last week. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

Morgan Ball, 17, was called into the office at Lee's Summit North High School on Friday morning, after turning up to class wearing 'jeans, a T-shirt and shoes, a shawl, a necklace, jewelry... and a corset' and was immediately told to remove the more flamboyant parts of his clothing, before being asked whether he had 'gender identity issues'. The news of the school's reaction to his birthday outfit sparked fury among his friends and peers, many of whom took to social media to share their outrage at the situation, using the hashtag #clothinghasnogender in order to generate further interest. Scroll down for video . Fighting back: Morgan Ball, pictured on his birthday last Friday, was asked by his teachers whether he had 'gender identity issues' because he wore jewelry and make-up to school . Totally normal: According to a close friend of Morgan's, who made a video about the incident, the outfit was just like any other outfit that Morgan would normally wear . Shortly after the incident, one of Morgan's closest friends, Lizzie, also created a video, using the popular hashtag as the title, in order to explain in detail what had happened between the teenager and the teachers. 'Morgan is gay but not a lot of people judge him for it... there are a select few in the school,' the high school student said. '...It was his birthday and he had dressed up for his birthday. He wore jeans, a T-shirt and shoes. He also wore a shawl, a necklace, jewelry, he had his nails painted, he had a glove on and a corset. 'He also put on make-up.' Lizzie continues by stressing that this type of outfit is completely 'normal' for Morgan, and for his friends who know him well. 'He was called down to the office and they told him - they asked him actually - if he had gender identity issues. They also said that it was a \"distraction to the learning environment for the children\" and they told him to take it off and he took it off.' Speaking out: Morgan's story quickly turned his #clothinghasnogender campaign into a viral social media sensation. The teenager is pictured here speaking to a local news outlet in his hometown . She adds: 'Morgan was really upset, he was crying at the end of the day. I've never seen him so hurt before, and I want to do something about it. The young girl goes on to explain that Morgan received an overwhelming amount of support from his classmates, reading out several of the tweets posted by pupils at the school using the hashtag #clothinghasnogender. 'I admire what Morgan did today, he is such a brave soul and I fully stand behind him,' one tweet read. Another said: 'Many students and faculty disagreed and have voiced their opinion that not allowing him to wear things that are allowed by the dress code is unfair and discriminatory.' And it seems that the viral campaign has already managed to make a change. Earlier today Morgan and his parents, Cheri and Jason Ball, met with school administrators to discuss the incident and talk about what changes the school would be willing to make to its dress code to avoid any similar incidents from occurring in the future. Ready for change: Morgan and his parents, Cheri and Jason Ball, met with teachers at the school (pictured) earlier today in order to try and make a positive change to its dress code . Excited: Both Cheri and Jason (pictured) said that they felt very positive about the steps that the school are taking to try and change the situation . 'I felt they heard us, we heard them. I'm really excited about working with them in the future,' Cheri told local news channel KCTV5. 'The fact that what he was wearing didn't break policy, it was more on the ambiguous side of it's distracting,' Morgan's father Jason added. The Ball family are now working on drafting up a new dress code policy in the hopes that the school's administrators can get it approved by the school board. 'I say just continue to be yourself,' Morgan said to KCTV5 after meeting with the school. 'It's very important as long as you feel you are following the school policy, they cannot take that away from you. 'And whatever makes you feel comfortable is what everyone else needs to realize.'\n",

And Eriksen says he is desperate to change the perception of Tottenham as the sort of team that fail to live up to their expectations after defeat by Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final this month. Christian Eriksen is sick of Tottenham being known as bottlers and wants to help change their reputation . Spurs lost 3-0 at Old Trafford against Manchester United last weekend to dent their top-four hopes . 'We can change the reputation, I really think so,' Eriksen said.

The man was with his wife on the 51st floor at the time but no criminal activity is suspected,The National\u00a0reports. More than 100 apartments in the 86-storey, 330-metre-tall skyscraper - a new tower in the expat-heavy Marina district of the city -\u00a0have been condemned and many stricken residents are still homeless.

Mr Flynn, who is originally from Dublin, Ireland and works as a hospitality investment consultant, was in London when the fire broke out but returned to Dubai to find devastation. His home, which he rents with his boss, is one of the 101 apartments to be condemned. He said: 'I was very lucky. A friend put me up for a couple of nights before I went to another friend.

Another Torch tower resident, who lived on the 81st floor with her sister, told MailOnline: 'We went back last week on Tuesday or Wednesday to check if the apartment was ok. 'Luckily, the water system did not go off and nothing was damaged. 'Sadly, we were there not to settle back in, but to take the basics of what we needed, turned off all non-necessary functioning electronics, emptied out the fridge and freezer and left for Abu Dhabi to stay with family. 'They did not feel that my sister and I were safe at the tower and want to know, as much as everyone else, what caused the fire. 'When we feel it is safe enough to go back, we will. 'Our neighbours apartment was badly burnt on the opposite side, where the fire climbed up. It's sad because they're a big family and now have to move else where.' Firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze in several hours after the fire alarm went off at around 2am local time. Residents of at least one neighbouring tower were told to evacuate as a precaution, but they were later allowed back inside. Disaster: The fire broke out in the Marina Torch tower on the northeastern end of the expat-heavy Marina district .

Debris from the fire cluttered nearby streets after the blaze was extinguished. Businesses and people living in nearby buildings came to the aid of the residents and the Italian embassy even sent chefs with pizza to raise their spirits. An evacuation centre was set up in a conference space in the nearby Princess Tower and as daylight broke, bystanders and residents could see that external cladding on the corners of the building were charred black and mangled for dozens of floors. Clean-up crews dressed in orange uniforms swept up pieces of shattered glass and other debris covering the street outside the building.

Just as the vehicle approaches a junction, the white Aygo traveling in the opposite direction turns right directly into his path. The accident took place on the A586 Great Eccleston bypass at St Michael's on Wyre in Lancashire, in August last year, but details have only just emerged. 'It is a miracle that no one was more seriously hurt given that it was a serious head-on smash at 50mph, said Mr Kay .

Write and relax and chill' Looking ahead:\u00a0The singer added that he had never felt more in control in his life and was seen hitting the recording studio in London the very next day . Meanwhile it has emerged that Zayn's new solo material will reportedly be released with Simon Cowell's record label. Syco, which already owns the rights to distributing One Direction music, is said to have secured an agreement with the former member who had left the band's contract early. 1D were believed to have signed a new \u00a310 million deal in 2013 to produce two more albums and a Greatest Hits, but with Zayn's announcement it seems Simon doesn't want to lose out on his investment. An insider told The Sun: 'Simon was very understanding about him leaving the band but quickly made it clear he would stay a Syco artist for his future projects. 'He\u2019ll now be able to make sure any releases are timed so they don\u2019t clash with anything by One Direction. Going solo: The singer admitted One Direction were 'no longer real' to him following his departure from the band . Hit-maker: Should Naught Boy collaborate with Zayn, their music will be distributed by Syco, which already owns the rights to distributing One Direction music . Wake up sleepyhead: After an emotionally draining week Zayn looked exhausted during his appearance with the producer . Stairway to heaven: Zayn has wasted no time in visiting the recording studio after returning from the South East Asian leg of One Direction's On The Road Again world tour . Drama:\u00a0Zayn's decision to leave the band came after he was signed off the current tour with stress, in the aftermath of cheating rumours that surrounded viral pictures that saw him cuddling up to a young, blonde holidaymaker Lauren Richardson in Thailand last week . 'My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. 'But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band.\u00a0I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart. 'I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22 year old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. 'I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world.' Speaking to The Sun\u00a0just six hours after saying that he wanted to be 'out of the spotlight', Zayn confirmed that his plan was to: 'Be myself for a bit. Write and relax and chill.' The singer added that he had never felt more in control in his life and was seen hitting the recording studio in London the very next day. Zayn previously claimed that he wanted to spend time being 'normal' but later told the paper's Dan Wootton that he stayed with the band for his following. 'You know, I did try to do something that I wasn't happy doing for a while, for the sake of maybe other people's happiness,' he said. 'And that was mainly the fans.' As part of Wednesday's statement to MailOnline, the band announced that they would make a fifth album as a four-piece and would tour again after Zayn's departure. Speaking about their future, Zayn confirmed that the boys were in it for the longhaul, adding: 'They still want to do it for a while, so they're going to carry on doing what they want to do.' Honest: The singer admitted that he had no 'master plan' about becoming a celebrity when he auditioned as a solo artist for the X Factor in 2010 . A welcome break: Naught Boy was left on the stairwell after ventured into the studio . He went on to say that he thought they would 'do ok' without him in the future. Zayn's decision to leave the band came after he was signed off the current tour with stress, in the aftermath of cheating rumours that surrounded viral pictures that saw him cuddling up to a young, blonde holidaymaker Lauren Richardson in Thailand last week. The rumours were said to have rocked his relationship with fianc\u00e9e of four years Perrie Edwards, but Zayn praised his Little Mix girlfriend in the interview for her consistent support, telling the newspaper that she was 'alright' about his decision and that she was 'a good girl'. Zayn's confirmation that he will continue with a pop career come after he was quoted as saying that he 'never' wanted to be famous. Workd to do: The singer was seen making his way to the studio earlier that day . The 22-year-old singer admitted that he had no 'master plan' about becoming a celebrity when he auditioned as a solo artist for the X Factor in 2010. In a previously unreleased interview from 2012, when asked if he expected his life to be how it is now, he told Rolling Stone magazine: 'No, not at all. This isn't what I thought I was going to be doing. I just went for the experience. 'I never went with a master plan, thinking, 'I want to be famous.' I literally went for an experience thing on the show and just hoped that... I guess I just got lucky.' The star also alluded to struggling with the success of the band, admitting he found it 'hard to put into words' how he felt about causing mass hysteria wherever he went. And even three years ago, Zayn appeared to hint about plans to take more of a back seat in the future. When asked if he could go back to a normal life ever again, he revealed that he would like to work in the background as a songwriter or producer.\n",

        "input": "Is there any sport better at self-criticism than Formula One? Here we are barely 24 hours after watching one of the greatest drivers ever to turn a wheel, Lewis Hamilton, winning the Australian Grand Prix in the most advanced car ever devised, yet some people have already applied the match to the paraffin. Nobody sane would suggest that Sunday's race was the most thrilling ever staged, but to call for rule changes to condense the field is ludicrously premature. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian GP win in front of second-placed Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel . Hamilton stormed to victory at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix following a dominant performance . Nico Rosberg followed Hamilton home as Mercedes picked up where they left off with total domination . I remember when, in 2010, refuelling was done away with and the season started with a horrific bore in Bahrain. Calls for the immediate rewriting of the regulations followed then, too. That urge was resisted and a fine season unfolded: four drivers contested the final round. Even last year, with Mercedes dominant, there were some memorable races \u2013 the best of them, this time, in Bahrain, with heart-in-your-mouth, wheel-to-wheel scrapping throughout the field. We should also provide some perspective. For most of the sport\u2019s history, the field was far more spread out than now. Laps upon lap, minute upon minute, were not uncommon gaps in the oily-rag days of yore. Sir Stirling Moss, for example, beat his nearest challenger, Mike Hawthorn, by 5min 12.75sec to win the 1958 Portuguese Grand Prix. You cannot legislate to make every grand prix interesting any more than you can make every football match interesting. Or every boxing match, or every athletics race. Thank goodness, too, because the thrill of sport would be diminished if we arrived knowing what to expect. Yet, unlike in football, Formula One feels an insatiable need to reinvent itself to \u2018improve the show\u2019. The navel-gazing is totally boring and counterproductive. Hamilton and Rosberg (right) shake hands after Mercedes pair finished more than 30 seconds ahead of third . Hamilton sprays champagne from the rostrum as he celebrates the 34th grand prix victory of his career . VIDEO Hamilton cruises to victory in Australian GP . It is also mostly self-serving. Teams cry for changes when they are failing to match their opponents, as Red Bull\u2019s Christian Horner did in calling for Mercedes to have their grunt reined in. Toto Wolff responded by telling Horner and the rest to get their \u2018f****** heads down and work hard\u2019. Yes, is Formula One not about striving for the best, winning the arms\u2019 race and getting your super-rich rewards? In passing, it is worth pointing out that the teams are far too powerful. The FIA, now presided over by Jean Todt, should surely be leading Formula One rather than following the consensus. If the sport does need an injection of competitiveness, we look to Nico Rosberg to play his part by challenging Hamilton in a way he did not manage in Melbourne. Last year see-sawed until Hamilton took near total command towards the end, and there is no reason to believe that Rosberg may not get the better of Hamilton at some stages this year. But for now we should celebrate the brilliance of Hamilton and his Mercedes machine, and stop moaning. Hollywood star\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger interviews Hamilton after his winning start to the season . Red Bull chief Christian Horner is concerned that Mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport . Red Bull\u2019s motorsport adviser Helmut Marko has warned, not for the first time, that the drinks company is considering leaving Formula One because the rules are not to their liking. This threat should be wafted away. It probably is not genuine, but, even if it is, so what? Global companies such as Mercedes, Toyota and Honda use the platform of Formula One to promote themselves so long as their boardrooms see an advantage in doing so. Then, when it no suits them, they suddenly stop. It is nothing to do with the regulations or the state of the sport. Understanding that is crucial to knowing there is no point bending over backwards to pacify transient visitors. Horner's Red Bull team won consecutive titles between\u00a02010-2013 with Sebastian Vettel behind the wheel . Mercedes chief Toto Wolff has told critics of his team to work to find a solution . Some wagging paddock tongues suggest that Manor never intended to race here in Australia. The suggestion is that they simply flew over the team and cars and parts to make it seem as if they would. Why? They stand to get \u00a328million in prize money by fulfilling their obligations to be in attendance, at least. (They have missed three races \u2013 at the end of last season \u2013 and cannot miss another under the terms of their contract.) Manor deny the accusation. They say a software problem caused their unavoidable 11th hour withdrawal, adding that they have not saved a penny by not taking part, having bought the fares and paid their staff in any case. Manor\u2019s revival, after the team previously known as Marussia went into administration last autumn, has been widely seen as a tonic for Formula One, beset by the overspending of the less successful teams (my interpretation), or by the iniquitous way it the sport is run (the popular narrative). However, it is unsettling that Manor, backed by OVO Energy entrepreneur Stephen Fitzpatrick, are paying just 1.3p in the pound to creditors. Manor driver Roberto Merhi walks along the grid during the drivers' parade but did not take part in the race . Spaniard Merhi waves to supporters before the first race of the season in Australia . It is no doubt reassuring for Manor\u2019s staff to know that the self-made Graeme Lowdon, sporting director of the old Marussia team and the new Manor team, is an experienced businessman. He made about \u00a33.5million when a previous business of which he was a director, the internet group J2C, closed amid the global technology crash in the early 2000s. Also among the lucky few was Alan Donnelly \u2013 Labour\u2019s one-time leader in the European Parliament and a close adviser to former FIA president Max Mosley \u2013 who collected \u00a3400,000 for his \u00a31,250 stake. Investors who bought shares when the company floated, shortly before its shares peaked, did considerably less well. One shareholder said at the time of J2C\u2019s closure: \u2018It seems unfair that the directors should be rewarded quite so well for failure.\u2019 Graeme Lowdon, CEO of Manor arrives in the paddock but the team did not start the race in Melbourne . Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, it was gratifying to note Lewis Hamilton\u2019s contribution to Mercedes\u2019 post-qualifying press conference. He stood at the back, put his hand up and said to his team boss Toto Wolff: \u2018From the Daily Mail, is there any news on the contract?\u2019 Wolff: \u2018No news on the contract, to the Daily Mail journalist.\u2019 I am happy to swap salaries with Lewis.

        "input": "A family of mountain lions who live in a national park were caught on camera in extreme close up gnawing on a dead deer. The images showing kittens P-32 and P-33, along with mother P-19, were unveiled Wednesday on Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area's Facebook page. The big cats were photographed tearing limbs, chomping and lapping up the bloody feast at the California park. First to arrive: Kitten P-33 is seen at the kill site. Her brother and mother reportedly arrived one hour later . Why hello there! P-33 peers up at the sky while inside the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area . Chowing down: Kitten P-33 gnaws on the deer carcass at the California park in February. At the time the photos were taken, P-33 was 15 months old . Feast: P-33 digs into her prey. A park ranger has said the animal had to use her carnassial teeth to make cuts . A National Park Service Ranger, identified by KTLA as Kate Kuykendall, wrote on Facebook that a remote camera was used for the images. She said that the feline family was snapped close to the line that separates LA County from Ventura County in the Santa Monica Mountains. Kuykendall wrote: 'Kittens normally stay with their mother until they are about one to one and a half years old. 'One of the siblings, P-34, had already dispersed and it appears that these kittens may have also left their mom since the photos were taken in mid-February. 'This is P-19\u2019s second litter and we've been tracking all three kittens since they were four weeks old. Lapping it up: P-33 licked one of the deer's leg during her meal. According to the National Park Service, mountain lions eat one deer weekly . Family meal: Mother P-19 (left) and her son P-32 (right) join in on the meal at Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area . All together: The three mountain lions were caught together in remote camera images . 'Since we started studying these animals in 2002, we have not tracked any male mountain lions that have successfully dispersed out of the Santa Monica Mountains.' Kuykendall wrote online that P-19 and P-32 arrived at the kill site approximately one hour after P-33. A caption for an image that showed kitten P-33 tearing the carcass said 'Mountain lions feed on deer by entering the abdominal cavity first and eating the insides, such as the liver and the heart.' Kuykendall also explained on Facebook the mechanisms that allowed P-33 to chow down. She wrote 'Notice how P-33 turns her head to the side while she bites through the deer hide? 'She is using her carnassial teeth, which are modified molars and premolars that act as shears to cut through the tough hide and meat. Mother and daughter: P-19 (closest to the camera) is seen with P-33 at the kill site . Approach: P-19 faces the camera - with meat left over from the deer carcass on the ground next to her . 'These sharp teeth are excellent at cutting and tearing flesh. 'Cats do not chew their food, so they actually use these carnassial teeth to tear and cut their meat up into smaller pieces to swallow whole.' On its website, the National Park Service says 'mountain lions typically eat about one deer per week, along with other smaller prey, and the animals in the Santa Monica Mountains are no exception.' Male and female mountain lions have general home ranges of approximately 200 and 75 square miles, respectively, according to the agency. The animals face threats that include roads and construction, as well as ingesting rat poisons, the National Park Service says. Information on visiting the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area can be found here. In the wild: Kitten P-33 is seen perched on rocks at the kill site .

        "input": "When Gareth Bale scored in the final of the European Cup and the Spanish Cup in the same season last year, he did something for Real Madrid that only Raul and Ferenc Puskas had managed before him. We can be fairly sure that no one ever tried to kick Puskas\u2019 1959 Mercedes 180 as it pulled out of the club\u2019s training ground. The same cannot be said for Bale\u2019s white Bentley, which was attacked as he left Madrid\u2019s Valdebebas training complex in the early hours of Monday morning after the Clasico. Gareth Bale has joined up with the Wales national team ahead of their upcoming match against Israel . Bale's car was attacked by angry Real Madrid fans following their 2-1 defeat by Barcelona on Sunday . The world's most expensive footballer was confronted by fans as he left the club's Valdebebas training base . The \u00a386million signing's white Bentley is struck by this fan while others jeered Wales international Bale . Bale has struggled to replicate the form he had shown during his first season at Real Madrid . Bale would not expect to have earned the same level of respect as the \u2018Galloping Major\u2019, who won three European Cups and scored 156 league goals in 180 games, but he has four trophies in his first year-and-a-half at the club, so the animosity he has encountered is impossible to justify and hard to understand. \u2018He scored the winner in the Spanish Cup final; he scored the winner in the Champions League final. He is already a Real Madrid legend,\u2019 gushed Madrid sports daily Marca when Bale won the European Cup in Lisbon last May. Its rival publication in the Spanish capital, Diaro AS added: \u2018Marcelo and (Cristiano) Ronaldo both scored afterwards but Bale\u2019s was the winner because it was game-over after that.\u2019 Those two publications have changed their tune 10 months on \u2014 dedicating pages to fan polls that call for the Welshman to be dropped. On Tuesday, 70 per cent of 8,000 supporters responding to one online survey said they wanted Bale left out of the team. There was no shortage of ammunition in the Madrid press, with statistics such as \u2018he never set foot in the penalty area in the second half against Barca\u2019 and \u2018he only played seven passes after the break \u2014 just three more than Lucas Silva who came on three minutes from time\u2019. The fan tries to give the car a kick as Bale pulls away and the abuse continues to be thrown his way in Spain . Bale and his Madrid team-mates lost 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Sunday night in a fiercely-contested El Clasico . An estimated 400 million people watched Bale struggle on television as Real moved four points behind Barca . Following the incidents that occurred involving three individuals in the early hours of Monday morning outside Ciudad Real Madrid, Real Madrid C. F. wishes to outline the following: . 1. The Club has already identified the individuals responsible, one a Real Madrid member, for these aggressive and violent actions against several of our players. 2. Details of this member's identity were sent to the Club's Discipline Commission, requesting that it expel the individual from Real Madrid for what is considered a very serious offence. 3. This afternoon, the Discipline Commission held an emergency meeting and decided to open a disciplinary investigation and provisionally suspend the individual's rights as a member and access to the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u or any Real Madrid facilities. 4. Real Madrid has notified Spain's National Anti-Violence Commission of the incidents that took place, as well as the identities of the individuals responsible, requesting that it apply those sanctions that it considers appropriate. 5. Furthermore, Real Madrid will take any applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for these incidents. All this supposedly supports the theory that Bale is in decline. But behind the numbers the story is a little more complicated than his critics care to admit. Bale came back to pre-season training in peak physical condition last summer and was comfortably the club\u2019s best player on the tour of the US, scoring in friendlies against Manchester United and Inter Milan. When Real Madrid went on a run of 22 straight wins, Bale scored in the 5-1 win over Basle that began that hot streak, he got two in the next game that saw them beat Deportivo 8-2 and netted again in the 5-1 win over Cordoba that followed. But a thigh injury suffered in October saw him miss three weeks of the season and in his absence Carlo Ancelotti fielded a midfield quartet of James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Isco. And that is where many of his current problems began. Bale has been criticised by Real supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013 . Bale followed in the footsteps of former Real Madrid duo Ferenc Puskas (left) and Raul by scoring in the final of the European Cup and the Spanish Cup during the same season . The Wales international took his anger out on a corner flag after netting a brace against Levante on March 15 . Real Madrid superstar Bale (right) will be hoping to lead Chris Coleman's Wales to Euro 2016 . Wales, who are currently just one point behind Group B leaders Israel, need Bale to be firing on all cylinders . The team kept winning and with the four passing midfielders the football resembled that played by Pep Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona which many Madrid followers had spent so long envying. The purists loved it and they also loved Isco\u2019s part in it \u2014 a Malaga lad who felt like one of their own. Bale came back into the team and his part in the club\u2019s historic run picked up where it had left off, scoring in the 2-0 win over San Lorenzo that made Real Madrid world club champions in December. But when the run came to an end in their next competitive game against Valencia, the season began to unravel and he became the scapegoat. In the defeat by Valencia he was blamed for squandering a late chance and ignoring Karim Benzema\u2019s screams for a pass. The idea that he should make way for Isco now went hand in hand with the theory that he was selfish. Ronaldo did him no favours in the next game when he very publicly chastised him for shooting instead of passing late in a match against Espanyol. \u2018Puta\u2019 (f***!) shouted the Portuguese throwing his arms down in disgust. Bale\u2019s every touch from there on in was whistled, despite the fact that he had scored direct from a free-kick earlier in the game \u2014 something that Ronaldo hasn\u2019t done now in over 50 attempts. The under-current of competition between Bale and Ronaldo is another factor. It is no secret that president Florentino Perez sees Bale as Ronaldo\u2019s eventual successor both on the pitch as a match winner and off it as a big-money contract winner. Cracks appear to be appearing in Bale's relationship with Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo . Bale and his girlfriend Emma Rhys-Jones\u00a0must decide where their young daughter goes to school . Ronaldo is not enamoured with the idea of being replaced by anyone and, despite the fact Bale lives in the same luxury \u2018La Finca\u2019 neighbourhood as Ronaldo, there is not the closeness between the two that has developed at Barcelona between Neymar and Lionel Messi. When Ronaldo threw a party for his 30th birthday, Bale was invited but did not attend \u2014 perhaps wisely, considering the fall-out that followed the festivities, coming as they did on the day of a 4-0 Madrid-derby defeat. Bale\u2019s partner Emma Rhys-Jones lives with him in Madrid although, with a young daughter Alba-Violet not yet three years of age, frequent trips can be made back to Wales. At some point in the future a decision will have to be made about schools. And he will need to be a sure that Madrid is the right city to justify putting down deeper roots. He says he barely noticed the thugs who tried to kick his car as he drove away from the training ground at 1.30am on Monday. But how long before the lack of respect from supporters, commentators and at times even team-mates begins to take its toll? Tuesday marked 10 months to the day since Madrid won the Champions League and Bale arrived back in the city at 4.30am to be greeted by an open-top bus that took him through streets filled with jubilant supporters. The Madrid homecomings are not as pleasant as they used to be.\n",

The Liverpool captain's dismissal, which came just 38 seconds after he came on from the bench at Anfield, was part of a disappointing afternoon for The Reds that saw them lose momentum in the race for a top-four finish in the Premier League. Here are Gerrard's eight red cards... Steven Gerrard's red card against Manchester United on Sunday was the midfielder's eighth of his career . September 1999 v Everton (Premier League) A 19-year-old Gerrard came off the bench midway through the second half and saw red in the 90th minute for a waist-high challenge on Kevin Campbell as the Toffees won 1-0 at Anfield. Gerrard was sent off for the first time as a teenager against Merseyside rivals Everton back in 1999 . April 2001 v Leeds (Premier League) Gerrard pulled a goal back for the Reds in this 2-1 home defeat before getting his marching orders in the 71st minute for up-ending David Batty. In 2001, Gerrard was shown a red card for a challenge on Leeds United midfielder David Batty . September 2001 v Aston Villa (Premier League) Having scored in the 46th minute, Gerrard was shown a straight red card 18 minutes from time for an awful studs-up tackle on George Boateng as his side slipped to a 3-1 home loss. A straight red card was shown to Gerrard in 2001 for a studs-up challenge on Aston Villa's George Boateng . May 2003 v Chelsea (Premier League) Gerrard was shown a second yellow card for a late foul on Graeme Le Saux in this 2-1 loss at Chelsea which saw the Blues qualify for the Champions League at the expense of Liverpool. In 2003, Gerrard was given his marching orders for a late challenge on Chelsea midfielder Graeme Le Saux . March 2006 v Everton (Premier League) Gerrard was sent off for two yellow cards after only 18 minutes, the first for kicking the ball away and the second for a foul on Kevin Kilbane. The Reds still went on to win the Anfield clash 3-1. Gerrard received a second booking for a late challenge on Everton midfielder Kevin Kilbane in 2006 . Despite Gerrard's dismissal, Liverpool still went on to win the match against Everton 3-1 . January 2011 v Manchester United (FA Cup) Liverpool lost the tie 1-0 at Old Trafford, with Gerrard seeing red after 32 minutes for diving into a tackle on Michael Carrick. Gerrard's lunge on fellow England midfielder Michael Carrick earned Gerrard a straight red at Old Trafford . September 2012 v Ukraine (World Cup qualifying) Gerrard picked up his only red card for England in a 1-1 draw with Ukraine at Wembley, receiving a second booking in the 88th minute for sliding in on Denys Garmash . Gerrard was sent off once for England during a World Cup qualifying match against Ukraine at Wembley . March 2015 v Manchester United (Premier League) Gerrard was sent off 43 seconds after his introduction as a half-time substitute at Anfield for a stamp on Ander Herrera, with United going on to win the match 2-1. Gerrard's dismissal on Sunday came just 38 seconds after he had come on to the pitch from the bench .\n",

He also said that Deen 'has a good soul' and 'a huge fan base.' 'Y'all are going to love the fabulous and flavorful products we have lined up for you to enjoy!' said Deen about her latest venture. In 2012 the celebrity chef was sued by a former employee who claimed the then-beloved Southern chef and her brother had made racist remarks at their Savannah, Georgia restaurant.

Paula Deen's Kitchen is described as a three-hour live program where she will cook some of her recipes and offer exclusive food and pantry items for purchase . In a court deposition, she admitted to using the 'N word' and later released a video, in tears, apologizing for the incident. 'I is what I is, and I'm not changing,' she famously told Today show host Matt Lauer. 'If there is anyone out there that has never said something that they wish they could take back, please pick up that stone and throw it so hard that it kills me.' In the aftermath of the scandal Deen was dropped by the Food Network, where she was a host for 13 years. She also lost millions in endorsement contracts and publishing deals when brands including Wal-Mart, Target, Ballantine Books, Caesars Entertainment and Home Depot dropped her. Last year Deen launched the digital Paula Deen Network, but Evine marks her official return to TV. Paula Deen's Kitchen will also air additional live segments once every six-to-eight weeks. 'I is what I is, and I'm not changing': Deen appeared on the Today show in tears in 2013 as her multi-million dollar empire collapsed .\n",

        "input": "A University of Southern California chief has vowed to carry out his own investigation into claims the son of Empire star Taraji P. Henson was 'racially profiled' on campus. The school's Public Safety director, John Thomas, said he was 'disturbed' by reports the actress's son Marcel had been stopped by police on campus for having his hands in his pockets. It comes after Henson revealed she had now decided to send the 20-year-old to historically black Howard University. Scroll down for video . Taraji P. Henson says her son Marcel was racially profiled by police at University of Southern California. The mother and son are pictured above at a film screening in Hollywood last April . Empire star Henson, 44, says her son was stopped at University of California (file picture) for having his hands in his pockets . In an interview with Uptown\u00a0magazine, she said her son was racially profiled elsewhere in California beforehand and did 'exactly everything the cops told him to do, including letting them illegally search his car. 'It was bogus because they didn\u2019t give him the ticket for what he was pulled over for,' she said. 'Then he\u2019s at University of Southern California, the school that I was going to transfer him to, when police stopped him for having his hands in his pockets.' After learning of the USC allegation, John Thomas revealed that he too had experienced racial profiling as a teenager . In a statement, he said: 'I was deeply disturbed to read news reports about a prospective student who felt profiled on or near campus because of his race. 'We encourage reporting of allegations of bias and I hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother. Henson has revealed she has now decided to send her 20-year-old son Marcel to historically-black college . 'I would like to look into this matter further and better understand who was involved and what took place. 'As someone who personally experienced racial profiling as a teenager, I have a stake in learning more about this incident and doing all I can to reach a just resolution.' He said he was not yet clear on which police departments were involved and that 'any allegation of bias or unequal treatment by university officers would trigger an investigation that I would supervise along with the university's Office of Equity and Diversity'. He continued: 'It is my expectation and that of the university that our department uphold the highest standards of constitutional policing, affording equal rights and respect to all persons.' Marcel is Henson's only child, and his father was her high school sweetheart. New hit: Henson currently stars on Fox drama Empire as Cookie Lyon, the recently-released-from-prison ex-wife of a music mogul (played by Terrence Howard) After revealing her son's ordeal, the 44-year-old said in the interview: 'So guess where he\u2019s going? Howard University. I\u2019m not paying $50K so I can\u2019t sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus. Also in the interview, Henson spoke about how happy she was to be one of now many black women leads on the small screen in shows like Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder. 'It feels good that there\u2019s not just one black person. I don\u2019t like that we get fixated on one or two at a time, or three at a time. If you look at Caucasian Hollywood, every year there\u2019s a handful of new faces you\u2019ve never seen before, then after that, they got five movies coming out and they\u2019re introducing you to more talent. So I\u2019m just so happy to see what\u2019s happening on television right now. We have options and that\u2019s how it should be,' Henson said.

A passenger who forced a plane to divert after becoming furious with a woman in front of him who had reclined her seat has been fined more than $7,000. Edmond Alexandre, 61, became irate after a woman reclined the seat in front of him on the Miami-to-Paris flight in August last year. A U.S. District Court in Boston heard how the man began to argue with the woman and other passengers, before chasing a flight attendant down the aisle where he 'grabbed his arm'. The federal judge decided to impose a a $1,000 (\u00a3675) fine and restitution of $6,303 (\u00a34,300) to American Airlines. Alexandre, who is a Haitian national, was flying back to Paris, where he lives, when the plane was forced to divert to Logan Airport in Boston. Two undercover federal air marshals aboard the plane then subdued Alexandre and handcuffed him, the U.S. attorney's office said. Massachusetts state police arrested Alexandre when the diverted plane landed. Four hours later the American Airlines flight resumed its journey onwards to France. U.S. media agencies report that Alexandre could have been facing 20 years in prison. The incident came just days after a United Airlines flight diverted to Chicago following a fight between two passengers over a reclined seat. United Flight 1462 from Newark, New Jersey to Denver was forced to make an emergency landing at O'Hare International Airport Sunday after a female passenger threw water at a man seated behind her who used a device known as Knee Defender to stop her from reclining her seat on the four-hour flight. The two passengers, both age 48, were interviewed by Chicago police, who deemed the incident a 'customer service issue,' according to Transportation Security Administration spokesman Ross Feinstein. Edmond Alexandre's anger saw him force an American Airlines plane to make an unscheduled landing . The plane then continued to Denver without them, arriving 1 hour and 38 minutes late, according to the airline's website. The Federal Aviation Administration can impose a civil fine of up to $25,000 for passengers who are unruly. In this case, no arrest was made, according to airport spokesman Gregg Cunningham. And then just days after the incident involving Mr Alexandre, a row between two women over a reclined seat led to the diversion of a New York to Palm Beach Delta flight to Jacksonville. According to the airline, the diversion was 'due to safety reasons in regard to a passenger issue' but Florida television station WPTV reported that the plane rerouted due to a dispute over a reclining seat. A man used a 'seat defender' on board one flight last year that prompted the woman in front to throw water over him - and that flight was also diverted (devices circled) Passenger Aaron Klipin told the station a woman sitting next to him got into an argument with a passenger behind her. The woman reclined her seat so she could knit while the other passenger was trying to sleep on the tray table. Klipin said the woman who was trying to take a nap started screaming and swearing, drawing the attention of the flight crew. According to the passenger, when a flight attendant came over, the dispute between the two women became even more heated, and the woman with her head on the tray table demanded that the plane be diverted. The stewardess went to talk to the pilot, who made the decision to land the plane 'out of an abundance of caution,' according to a Delta spokesman. A few minutes later, the flight touched down in Jacksonville, where it was met by local law enforcement officials who removed the unruly woman from the plane. The three incidents in the space of some nine days on U.S. airlines became known as legroom wars.\n",

The moms said that though they have no experience in the business of fashion, the idea for buddingSTEM -STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math - came out of experiences with their own daughters. Scroll down for video .

Jennifer Muhm (left) and Malorie Catchpole (right) said they came up with the idea of buddingSTEM after experiences they had with their own daughters . 'We're not anti-princess. We're not anti-pink. We're not anti-girly. We just think there needs to be more than just that offered for our girls,' Muhm, 37, of Shoreline, Washington, told ABC News. She said her now-five-year-old daughter wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween in 2013, but noticed the costume catalog only had boys wearing the costume. 'She looked at me and said, 'I can't be an astronaut. They're only for boys',' Muhm told ABC. After seeing pictures of Sally Ride, Joan Higginbotham and other female astronauts, however, her daughter still dressed up as an astronaut, according to the moms' Kickstarter page. Muhm said her daughter wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween, but was put off by the fact that only boys wore the costume in the catalogs . Muhm and Catchpole said that their daughters are interested in things that are not usually found on girls' clothing, including space ships, dinosaurs and trains . Muhm told Catchpole, 34, also of Shoreline, about the issue and they were both frustrated. Catchpole told ABC that her three-year-old daughter is 'very into trains' and when she and her husband wanted to buy train-themed underwear as a gift to their daughter for Christmas, they could only find boy's underwear. Catchpole bought them anyway. 'I was actually at their house on Christmas and saw the boys' underpants under the tree, and it was that moment that it kind of clicked,' Muhm said. 'I said, 'You know what, Malorie? We should make underpants with trains on them\u2026 and then we thought why just underpants: There are no dinosaurs or rocket ships on leggings or dresses for girls',' she added. The women, who have no experience in the business of fashion created dresses, leggings, T-shirts and underwear for girls between 18 months and eight years old . BuddingSTEM - STEM standing for science, technology, engineering and math - was registered as a business in April 2014. Since the business's origination, the moms have raised more than $52,500 for the company through a Kickstarter . And so the pair filed their business registration for buddingSTEM in April 2014. 'If there is something that is not fair - because my daughter will say that it is not fair - you can actually start working toward doing something about it,' said Muhm. With help from a inputile designer and a Kickstarter that helped them raise $52,500 to date, the clothing line will be available in July. 'One of the things that I'm happiest about\u2026 is what I think we've shown our daughters,' Catchpole said. 'We're two working moms. We don't have a background in fashion, and we saw a need and we worked hard.' The clothing line features simply designed outfits that are easily mixed-and-matched with train, space and dinosaur themes. Clothing can come in blue and pink or teal and gray .

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted there was \u2018no alliance\u2019 between the two coalition parties at the coming election, and said the coalition had made it more difficult for both parties to keep their promises. She stressed that an outright Tory win was still possible - and preferable - but said the Tories would make a new deal with the Lib Dems work. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan suggested the Tories were ready to make a deal with the Lib Dems work . Mrs Morgan told the BBC\u2019s Question Time programme: \u2018I think if that\u2019s what the electorate presents us with I am sure we will try and make that work. I work with (Lib Dem schools minister) David Laws in the education department on a day by day basis.\u2019 Her comments are the clearest indication yet that the Tory leadership is laying the groundwork for a second deal with Nick Clegg if, as polls predict, the election produces another hung parliament. The move will prove hugely controversial with some senior Tories, who believe the party should try to go it alone in minority government if it emerges from the election as the largest party at Westminster, rather than accept the inevitable compromises of coalition.. London Mayor Boris Johnson told the Daily Mail last week that Mr Cameron should categorically rule out another deal with the Lib Dems. \u2018In my view we should say, \u201cstuff coalition with anyone\u201d, he said. \u2018We are there to win, we are there to offer leadership, we are there to be a Conservative government. \u2018If we go into this issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party it would be absolutely fatal.\u2019 It raises the prospect of a repeat of the scenes in May 2010 when David Cameron and Nick Clegg entered government together . Tory MP Peter Bone yesterday said Mrs Morgan was wrong to even countenance a second coalition with the Lib Dems. \u2018I don\u2019t agree with her \u2013 I think we should try with a minority government if we fall short,\u2019 he said. \u2018Nobody has said to me, in the thousands of doors I have knocked on, that they want another coalition government.\u2019 But a new poll of MPs conducted by Dods, suggested that almost half of Tory MPs (48 per cent) would prefer to have another coalition with the Lib Dems if the party fails to get a majority. Just 26 per cent said the party should rule out a coalition. Some 17 per cent said they would prefer a deal with Ukip. However, the survey found that just 29 per cent of Lib Dem MPs want to do another deal with the Tories, while 43 per cent would prefer a deal with Labour and 29 per cent would prefer to avoid any coalition at all. London Mayor Boris Johnson last week urged Mr Cameron to categorically rule out another deal with the Lib Dems . The right-wing Spectator magazine reported this week that Mr Cameron has already begun private discussions about forming a second coalition with Mr Clegg. It said it was aware of \u2018at least two detailed discussions that Cameron has had on the topic in recent weeks. He said the same in both \u2013 no matter what they might hear to the contrary, he does not want to run a minority government.\u2019 However, the annual British Social Attitudes Report found little enthusiasm for another five years of coalition, despite broad acceptance for many of the current Government's reforms. The NatCen survey found backing for the idea of coalition government had slumped to its lowest level for 30 years.\n",

De La Hoya knows all about both boxers having lost to both Pacquiao and Mayweather during his professional career and believes the Filipino will be a tough challenge for the unbeaten American due to his southpaw stance. The Golden Boy Promotions founder, who lost to Mayweather in May 2007 and Pacquiao in June 2008, also revealed his excitement at being able to see the two box office fighters go toe-to-toe in the ring. Oscar De La Hoya believes Floyd Mayweather will face a tough test when he takes on Manny Pacquiao . De La Hoya, speaking to Fight Hype, said: 'It's just gratifying to know that his fight is finally taking place. 'On May 2 we are finally going to have the opportunity to watch Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao. 'A lot of people can argue it is maybe a few years too late but I really do feel that Mayweather and Pacquiao still have a lot left in the tank to make it a really good fight. As a boxing fan I'm really looking forward to it. 'I have always preached to the boxing fans, to the writers and the reporters that we must demand the best fights. We must demand the best fighting the best. Mayweather defeated De La Hoya at the MGM Grand Garden Arena back in May 2007 . De La Hoya also fell to a defeat against Pacquiao during a bout at the MGM Grand Garden Arena\u00a0in June 2008 . 'As long as the public is asking for these great fights then we have a great chance of seeing them.' When asked if Pacquiao will be Mayweather's hardest test to date, De La Hoya replied: 'I believe so because you have take into account that Pacquiao is a southpaw. 'If he has the legs for 12 rounds to move inside, outside, side to side and throw a lot of punches then I really do feel that Pacquiao can do some damage to Mayweather. 'But then again Mayweather is a masterful boxer. He is a master at defence so it is just going to be a really entertaining fight.'\n",

        "input": "(CNN)It's time for leaders in Israel and the United States to call off their war of insults before they cause serious, lasting damage. Heading into Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, both sides should immediately agree to a cease fire. The speech itself is a terrible mistake. Arranging it without prior consultation with the White House was not only an affront to Barack Obama but to the Presidency itself. One would have thought that after all the uproar, Netanyahu would have caught a \"cold\" and postponed, but now that he plans to go ahead, he should at least give a measured, thoughtful address -- not the barn burner for which he is known. But let's be clear: he also deserves a respectful hearing in Congress from both sides of the aisle. Blame for the deterioration in relations is shared here in America as well as in Israel. This conflict began on a personal level. Those close to Obama and Netanyahu say the two men took an instant dislike years ago and have since descended into loathing one another. Obama, they say, regards Netanyahu as headstrong, bombastic and reckless. Netanyahu sees Obama as weak, unreliable and priggish. The Obama team also accuses Netanyahu of timing his Congressional speech to rally Israeli voters behind him in elections two weeks away -- Bibi as Churchill standing up to the Nazis -- while Netanyahu's team is convinced Obama is desperate for a deal to burnish his legacy -- the Nobel laureate who brought peace. Each thinks the other endangers the future of the world and each has allowed his top lieutenants to viciously attack the other in the press. But in recent months what began as personal antipathy has deepened and widened into a serious split over the best way to head off Iran's aggressive push to become a nuclear power. The Iranian threat has long been vexing; former Defense Secretary Bob Gates once told me it was the toughest problem he saw in nearly a half century serving of distinguished service in national security. There are no obvious solutions acceptable to key parties. The Obama administration believes that a compromise agreement with Iran limiting -- but not dismantling -- its nuclear capability is better than to have current talks fall apart, risking an armed showdown. The Netanyahu government believes the agreement which Obama appears ready to accept will let Iran eventually wriggle free and build a bomb. In truth, there is merit to both points of view -- and the devil here is not only in the details but in the very structure of an agreement. As Obama believes, a negotiated settlement is far preferable to a possible war or learning to live with a nuclear Iran. But what is alarming not only to Israel but to other American friends in the region -- and rightly so -- is that the U.S. and its partners in the negotiation with Iran (Russia, China, the UK, France, Germany) have made repeated concessions to get an Iranian signature without getting major concessions in return. Consider: The U.S. and Israel started down the negotiating path saying publicly that Iran must totally dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of punishing economic sanctions against Teheran. Leaks since then have shown that in pursuit of a deal, the U.S. is now willing to accept more and more centrifuges in Iran -- 6,500 by latest count. Washington and Tel Aviv once talked of an agreement that would last at least 20 years. \u200b According to the latest leaks, the agreement may only cover 10 years and then give the Iranians a chance to bust loose. This is only the beginning of a long litany of differences. In defense of U.S. compromises, Secretary of State John Kerry makes a persuasive point that a temporary agreement reached 18 months ago containing compromises has worked far better than critics have conceded and therefore, those now at the table deserve a benefit of doubt. But administration critics are also right in arguing that the Obama administration seems to be betting that if just given a few years grace, an odious regime which sponsors terrorism across the Middle East will suddenly change spots and become a partner for peace. In times past, American and Israeli leaders have sometimes had bad blood and still made substantive progress. President Jimmy Carter could barely stand Israeli leader Menachem Begin but they and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat shaped the Camp David accords in 1978. Despite sometimes bitter words during Israel's recent dust-up with Hamas -- especially directed by Israel against Secretary Kerry -- Obama ensured that Israel was well supplied militarily, particularly with the Iron Dome missile defense system that saved countless Israeli lives. But today's rift seems far more perilous. It is not only personal but substantive and comes at a moment of spreading turmoil across the Middle East. Israel should remember that America is its best friend in a world where anti-Semitism is once again raising its hideous head. The United States should appreciate that for Israel, a nuclear Iran could pose instant annihilation. America also has Arab friends in the Middle East who have vital interests here -- friends like Saudi Arabia who, if an agreement is weak, will feel compelled to pursue their own bomb, unleashing a lethal arms race. This is a moment that demands that leaders in both Israel and the United States lower their voices, take their differences indoors and begin restoring broken bonds of trust. In private talks, they should work hard finding ways to bridge differences between them, starting with creative proposals coming recently from veteran U.S. diplomats. Dennis Ross, for example, argues that if the U.S. could greatly strengthen an inspections regime -- a much bigger team who could go anywhere, any time in Iran -- and could enshrine in legislation that Iranian violations will bring military action, that would go a long way toward allaying opposition fears. Martin Indyk proposes that, drawing upon ideas embraced by President Clinton in Middle East negotiations 15 years ago, the U.S. could enter a formal treaty with Israel, voted upon by Congress, that would provide a U.S. \"nuclear guarantee\" to Israel in event of an Iranian breakout. In short, the moment is dire but not hopeless. What is clearly needed is a cease fire. Secretary Kerry seemed to be pointing in that direction Sunday when he said Netanyahu is welcome to speak in the U.S. on Tuesday. Others should now take up the cause, recognizing that our real adversaries are not in Tel Aviv or Washington but among those in Teheran who support terror and mayhem across the Middle East.\n",

        "input": "(CNN)For the second time, a Georgia woman's execution has been postponed -- this time because of concerns about the drugs to be used. Kelly Renee Gissendaner was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. ET Monday. \"Prior to the execution, the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency. The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits,\" the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement. \"Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the Execution Team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, Inmate Gissendaner's execution has been postponed.\" The 47-year-old was originally scheduled to die on Wednesday, but that execution was called off because of winter weather. A petition saying the mother of three has turned her life around, even earning a theology degree while in prison, had garnered about 80,000 signatures as of Tuesday morning. Organizers plan to deliver it to Gov. Nathan Deal, though in Georgia, the governor has no authority to grant clemency. Gissendaner has become a \"powerful voice for good,\" the petition says of the woman convicted of orchestrating her husband's death in 1997. \"While incarcerated, she has been a pastoral presence to many, teaching, preaching and living a life of purpose,\" the petition states. \"Kelly is a living testament to the possibility of change and the power of hope. She is an extraordinary example of the rehabilitation that the corrections system aims to produce.\" On Sunday night, about 200 people attended a vigil at Emory University's Cannon Chapel, where they sang her praises. \"Killing her is not going to bring anything back. It's not going to undo what's been done,\" priest Kelly Zappa told CNN affiliate WSB. The pleas did not sway Georgia's high court or its board of pardons. In a 5-2 decision Monday afternoon, the state Supreme Court denied her request for a stay, and it also dismissed a constitutional challenge claiming that her sentence was disproportionate. And the State Board of Pardons and Paroles said Monday evening that its decision last week to deny clemency in the case stands. Not since Lena Baker, an African-American convicted of murder and pardoned decades later, has Georgia executed a woman. The state was scheduled to snap that 70-year streak last week before Gissendaner's execution was first postponed. Just hours before she was scheduled to die by injection at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson last Wednesday, the Georgia Department of Corrections announced it had postponed the execution until Monday at 7 p.m. \"due to weather and associated scheduling issues,\" department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said. Gissendaner was convicted in a February 1997 murder plot that targeted her husband in suburban Atlanta. She was romantically involved with Gregory Owen and conspired with the 43-year-old to have her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, killed, according to court testimony. Owen wanted Kelly Gissendaner to file for a divorce, but she was concerned that her husband would \"not leave her alone if she simply divorced him,\" court documents said. The Gissendaners had already divorced once, in 1993, and they remarried in 1995. Details of the crime, as laid out at trial and provided by Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, are as follows: . Kelly Gissendaner and Owen planned the murder for months. On February 7, 1997, she dropped Owen off at her home, gave him a nightstick and hunting knife, and went out dancing with girlfriends. Douglas Gissendaner also spent the evening away from home, going to a church friend's house to work on cars. Owen lay in wait until he returned. When Douglas Gissendaner came home around 11:30 p.m., Owen forced him by knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of Gwinnett County. There, Owen ordered his victim into the woods, took his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery, hit him in the head with the nightstick and stabbed Douglas Gissendaner in the neck eight to 10 times. Kelly Gissendaner arrived just as the murder took place, but she did not immediately get out of her car. She later checked to make sure her husband was dead, then Owen followed her in Douglas Gissendaner's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that Kelly Gissendaner had left for him. Owen set her husband's car on fire in an effort to hide evidence and left the scene with Kelly Gissendaner. Police discovered the burned-out automobile the morning after the murder but did not find the body. Authorities kicked off a search. Kelly Gissendaner, meanwhile, went on local television appealing to the public for information on her husband's whereabouts. Her and Owen's story started to unravel after a series of police interviews. On February 20, Douglas Gissendaner's face-down body was found about a mile from his car. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck, but the medical examiner couldn't tell which strike killed Douglas Gissendaner because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck. On February 24, Owen confessed to the killing and implicated Kelly Gissendaner, who was arrested the next day and charged. While in jail awaiting trial, Kelly Gissendaner grew angry when she heard that Owen was to receive a 25-year sentence for his role in the murder. (Owen is serving life in prison at a facility in Davisboro, according to Georgia Department of Corrections records.) She began writing letters to hire a third person who would falsely confess to taking her to the crime scene at gunpoint. She asked her cellmate, Laura McDuffie, to find someone willing to do the job for $10,000, and McDuffie turned Kelly Gissendaner's letters over to authorities via her attorney. Kelly Gissendaner has exhausted all state and federal appeals, the attorney general said in a statement last week. In the clemency application, Gissendaner's lawyers argued she was equally or less culpable than Owen, who actually did the killing. Both defendants were offered identical plea bargains before trial: life in prison with an agreement to not seek parole for 25 years. Owen accepted the plea bargain and testified against his former girlfriend. Gissendaner was willing to plead guilty, her current lawyers said, but consulted with her trial lawyer and asked prosecutors to remove the stipulation about waiting 25 years to apply for parole. According to her clemency appeal, her lead trial attorney, Edwin Wilson, said he thought the jury would not sentence her to death \"because she was a woman and because she did not actually kill Doug. ... I should have pushed her to take the plea but did not because I thought we would get straight up life if she was convicted.\" Her appeal lawyers also argued that Gissendaner had expressed deep remorse for her actions, become a model inmate and grown spiritually. They said her death would cause further hardship for her children. For her last meal, she requested an extravagant one: two Burger King Whoppers with cheese (with everything), two large orders of fries, popcorn, cornbread, a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese, boiled eggs and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing, the Corrections Department said. She also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert. According to the Death Penalty Information Center: . \u2022 Between 1973 and 2012 -- the most recent data available -- 178 death sentences were imposed upon female offenders. These sentences constitute about 2% of all death sentences. \u2022 Five states -- North Carolina, Florida, California, Ohio and Texas -- account for over half of all such sentences. \u2022 As of December 31, 2012, there were 61 women on death row. \u2022 Women on death row range in age from 28 to 79. They have been on death row from a few months to over 26 years. Currently the only woman on Georgia's death row, Gissendaner would be the second woman in the state's history to be executed. The first was Baker, an African-American maid who was sentenced to death by an all-white, all-male jury in 1944. She claimed self-defense for killing a man who held her against her will, threatened her life and appeared poised to hit her with a metal bar before she fired a fatal shot. Sixty years after her execution, Georgia's parole board posthumously pardoned her after finding that \"it was a grievous error to deny (her) clemency.\" Such pardons are rare, but so are executions of women. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, only 15 women have been executed in the United States since 1977. CNN's Holly Yan, Tina Burnside, Greg Botelho, Tristan Smith and John Murgatroyd contributed to this report.\n",

Skeptic Stefan Lanka made the undertaking in an advert that he posted online several years ago. Doctor David Bardens attempted to claim the prize after providing the biologist with a \u00a0comprehensive study that had been published in a medical journal. Lanka was hauled before a German Court when he failed to uphold his side of the bargain and pay up, reported\u00a0The Local. A Judge in the regional court in Ravensburg, South Germany, ruled in the favour of Dr Bardens and found that he had met the criteria of the advert. Lanka claims that the illness is not a virus and is psychosomatic, according to the BBC. He has reportedly said that he will now appeal the decision, according to The Local. Germany is currently in the middle of a debate about whether vaccinations should be made compulsory after a recent outbreak of the virus. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and can sometimes lead to serious complications. Scroll down for video . It is now very uncommon in the UK due to the effectiveness of the MMR vaccination, according to the NHS. In the US public health officials are struggling to\u00a0persuade more\u00a0parents vaccinate their children. In some states, the number of parents seeking exemptions from school attendance vaccination requirements has been inching up. The rise has come despite unsettling outbreaks of some vaccine-preventable diseases that had nearly disappeared from the United States. 'I think we're all kind of frustrated,' said Stephen Morse, a Columbia University infectious disease expert. In West Africa scientists are warning that hard-to-treat areas that have already been hit by Ebola are now at risk of a measles outbreak. Ebola derailed child immunisations in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, leaving hundreds of thousands more children vulnerable to the more routine infections, researchers said. Measles epidemics often follow humanitarian crises because 'measles is so incredibly contagious,' explained Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Justin Lessler, who led the study published in the journal Science. 'Measles is not the only health threat that has been made worse by the Ebola crisis, and may not even be the most dire, but it is one we can do something about,' he added.

        "input": "A 15-year-old girl who made a heartbreaking video about the abuse she suffered at the hands of bullies died last week. Toni Connell died in hospital after emergency services were called to her home in South Ockendon, Essex, last Wednesday. It came just weeks after the year 11 student was told she would not be allowed to sit the higher paper in her upcoming GCSE maths exam and would therefore be unable to achieve and A or B grade. Tragic: Schoolgirl Toni Connell, pictured, was found dead at her home in South Ockendon, Essex, last week . The circumstances of Toni's death are not yet known but it is not being treated as suspicious by police. Speaking yesterday, her mother, Amanda Connell, 46, said she believed academic pressure had led to her daughter's death. The mother-of three also said the schoolgirl had been the victim of cyber-bullying and had received death threats on Facebook. She said: 'We found out during a parents evening a few weeks ago that Toni would not be allowed to do A and B questions in her maths exam. 'We had been discussing [the exam] just hours before she died. The school puts a lot of pressure on the children - they have to take some responsibility and make changes. 'She was going in at 7.30 in the morning and coming home at 4pm exhausted as she was trying to fit in extra study sessions. 'Once Year 11 hit the pressure increased even more and I think it just became unbearable for her. Heartbreaking: Two of the notes featured in the five-minute video Toni uploaded to the internet last March . In one note she said she was '14, but so small' and in another said 'Loads of stuff gets spread about me' Toni Connell wrote 'loads of people hate me' on one heartbeaking note and held up another message saying 'been bullied since year 7' Bullied: The handwritten notes showed names that Toni had been called, including 'ugly' Desperate plea: Messages included the words 'I don't know what to do' and 'suicidal 5 times' 'We are hurting right now but if Toni's death can prevent another child needlessly dying then she will at least have achieved something.' In March last year, Toni uploaded a heartbreaking video to in which she shared how she had 'one true friend' and that 'loads of people hate' her. On handwritten notes, she wrote:\u00a0'The next three names I have been called... ugly, lesbian tramp.' She also shared: 'to be popular you have to be a s**g long hair pretty, have boobs'. One card read: 'Suicidal 5 times.' The next: 'Don't do suicide. Don't let them win'. Asked about an anti-bullying video online posted by Toni, Mrs Connell added: 'I am very angry with the school as they knew she was being bullied but never did anything about it. 'I know children must have picked on her about her brace as she had been excited about getting it but once she went to school she was immediately begging us to have it taken off. 'I didn't even know about the video though.' Paying tribute to her daughter, she said: 'Toni was bubbly and talkative. She loved animals - we had 13 rabbits but her pride and joy was her hamster, Tibbles. Bright future: Tributes were laid for Toni as her mother spoke of her 'bubbly and talkative' daughter . Remembered: Candles, flowers and what appears to be a signed school shirt have been left in tribute . 'She was always singing and dancing. Her ambition was to be an actress on Hollyoaks and she had an audition for a drama college that she was looking forward to attending.' Paramedics and the air ambulance were called to Toni's home last Wednesday but were unable to revive her. She later died at Queen's Hospital, Romford, Essex. A police statement said: 'Specially-trained officers have been providing support to Toni's family. Her death is not being treated as suspicious.' A date has not yet been set for the inquest. Commenting on Toni's death, a school spokesman said: 'It is with great sadness that we are coming to terms with the death of Toni. 'The whole school community is deeply affected by this tragedy.' Barbara King, the academy's executive principal said: 'The Ockendon Academy has been working closely with Thurrock Council\u2019s Children\u2019s Services as well as Community Adolescent Mental Health Services to support our young people and staff in the school following the tragic death of Year 11 student Toni Connell. Pupil:\u00a0Toni Connell was told by staff at The Ockendon Academy, Essex, pictured, that she would have to sit the foundation level GCSE maths paper,\u00a0which allows pupils to achieve a maximum of a C grade . 'We are aware that this tragic news can lead to speculation in the press and on social media regarding the circumstances around Toni\u2019s death and have advised parents that police are working to establish the circumstances surrounding the tragedy and how it would be inappropriate for the school to comment further while those investigations continue. 'Parents are also being advised if they have any concerns regarding their children they should contact the school directly so we can ensure they get access to support in school and so we can offer further one-to-one advice.' Ockendon Academy chair of governors, Rev Brian Duckworth, said in an online statement: 'It is with great sadness that we have to inform you that we have learned today of the death of a young person, Toni Connell a year 11 student at our school. 'We know that your children may be deeply affected by this sad news and we have offered support to all students in the school and there will be additional counselling available. 'If you have concerns about your child please let the school know so we can make support available for them next week. 'If your child needs to talk to someone over the weekend please be aware that the Childline telephone service is available on 0800 1111.

        "input": "Labour rounded on more than 100 of Britain's top business leaders today after they backed the Conservatives' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a 'change of course'. In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election, the business chiefs claimed a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'. But Ed Miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the Tories were on the side of 'a few big firms and individuals at the top'. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, meanwhile, dismissed the signatories as a 'cosy little club', while Labour peer John Precott went further criticising them as 'tax dodgers, Tory voters and non-doms'. Scroll down for video . Bosses behind big name retailers, drinks and restaurants have backed the Tory economic plan, including (top row) Primark and Costa, (middle row) and LK Bennett, (bottom row) Ladbrokes, Cobra, Tango and Iceland . David Cameron, however, insisted the intervention was 'unprecedented' and claimed it sent a 'very powerful message'. The business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee. Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride are also on the list. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. However, Mr Miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election. He said: 'Businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and, you know, that doesn't surprise me. 'But it does also go to the wider choice at this election. The Conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well, the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else. 'We have tried that experiment over the last few years and it hasn't worked. We have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work. I just have a different view about the way the country succeeds.' Mr Umunna went further dismissed it as a 'letter organised by the Conservative Party in a Conservative-supporting newspaper' after it was first published in the Daily Telegraph. But Mr Cameron, touring Marston's brewery in the Wolverhampton today, said the letter from business leaders was 'very powerful'. David Cameron and George Osborne visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton today on the second full day of the general election campaign . Mr Cameron said the letter from business leaders was 'very powerful' while the Chancellor claimed it was 'unprecedented' Tory officials said the number of signatories to the open letter (above) made it 'unprecedented' in the history of British general elections . He said: 'Today it is an unprecedented intervention by some of the business leaders in the best-known business, large and small, in our country saying the Conservative long-term plan is working, generating jobs. 'That is a very clear message from business leaders who, like me, care about jobs and wealth creation and prosperity and livelihoods in our country.' Chancellor George Osborne added: 'The warning from Britain's business leaders couldn't be clearer: a change of course will threaten jobs, deter investment, send a negative signal about our country and put the recovery at risk.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the letter was a tribute to the work of the Coalition government, and claimed an outright Tory win would \u2018pose a very real threat\u2019 to Britain\u2019s stability. The Lib Dem leader said yesterday: \u2018I read the letter carefully, it talks about what this coalition government has done, and I think the signatories to the letter are completely right in saying that about the last thing that this country needs, now that we\u2019re emerging from this long shadow of the economic crash in 2008, is a great lurch in one direction or another.' However, the Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the signatories were 'not exactly representative' of the business community and should 'be careful what they wish for', accusing some of signing up 'naively' to a Tory stunt. The business leaders were particularly positive about Mr Osborne's strategy of seeking to encourage investment by slashing corporation tax, which fell to 20 per cent this week, having stood at 28 per cent when the Government came to power in 2010. 'David Cameron and George Osborne's flagship policy of progressively lowering corporation tax to 20 per cent has been very important in showing the UK is open for business. It has been a key part of their economic plan,' the business leaders said in the letter. 'The result is that Britain grew faster than any other major economy last year and businesses like ours have created over 1.85million new jobs.' The list of signatories includes senior executives of nine FTSE 100 companies. It includes senior figures such as Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg. The list includes five signatories who previously supported New Labour including Sir Charles Dunstone, chairman of Dixons Carphone and Talk Talk, who signed a letter backing the party before the 2005 election. Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne, who unveiled a 'seaside manifesto' with Gordon Brown before the 2010 general election, is also a signatory. Ed Miliband, speaking at engineering company David Brown Gear Systems in Huddersfield today, provoked another row with business by proposing further restrictions on zero-hours contracts . The Labour leader took a selfie taken with a worker as he arrives for a Q&A session at the factory in Huddersfield . Former Marks & Spencer chief Stuart Rose warned last night the Labour's plan to raise corporation tax would 'choke off the recovery'. Ed Balls yesterday confirmed Labour will raise corporation tax for the first time in 40 years, despite warnings it could cost more than 100,000 jobs. The cash will be used to fund a \u00a3400 cut in business rates for smaller firms. But Lord Rose said: 'The more I hear from Labour, the more concerned I become. They don't get business. 'Labour talk a lot about spending money \u2013 but what about earning it? Ed Miliband and Ed Balls seem intent on pitting small businesses against large businesses, saddling the engine rooms of our country with higher corporation taxes and crippling entrepreneurs \u2013 all of which would choke off the recovery.' 1 Rooney Anand CEO, Greene King . 2 Surinder Arora MD, Arora International . 3 John Ayton Founder of Bremont Watches . 4 Alex Baldock CEO Shop Direct . 5 Lord Bamford Chairman, JCB . 6 Duncan Bannatyne Founder, Bannatyne Group . 7 Robert Bensoussan CEO, LK Bennett . 8 Lord Karan Bilimoria Chairman and founder, Cobra Beer . 9 Charlie Bradshaw MD, Matrix APA . 10 Baroness Brady Vicechairman, West Ham . 11 Graham Chipchase CEO, Rexam . 12 Zameer Choudrey CEO, Bestway Group . 13 Neil Clifford CEO, Kurt Geiger . 14 Steven Cohen CEO, Blue Inc. 15 Glenn Cooper MD, ATG Access . 16 Andrew Coppel CEO, De Vere . 17 Gerald Corbett Chairman, Britvic . 18 Peter Cullum Founder and Deputy Chairman, Towergate . 19 Ron Dennis Chairman, McLaren Technology . 20 Julietta Dexter Owner, Communications Store . 21 Annoushka Ducas Founder, Annoushka Jewellery . 22 Bob Dudley, CEO, BP . 23 Sir Charles Dunstone Chairman, Dixons Carphone . 24 John Elliott Chairman, Ebac . 25 Mark Esiri Director, notonthehighstreet.com . 26 Ralph Findlay CEO, Marstons . 27 Richard Glynn CEO, Ladbrokes . 28 Ben Gordon Chairman, Powerleague . 29 Julian Granville MD, Boden . 30 Peter Grauer Chairman, Bloomberg . 31 Philip Green Chairman, Carillion . 32 Michael Gutman President and COO, Westfield . 33 Wendy Hallet MD and Founder, Hallet Retail . 34 Jenny Halpern Prince Founder, Halpern . 35 Andy Harrison CEO, Whitbread . 36 Aidan Heavey CEO, Tullow Oil . 37 Oliver Hemsley founder and CEO, Numis . 38 Joe Henderson Founder and CEO, Henderson . 39 Vernon Hill Founder and chairman, Metro Bank . 40 Anya Hindmarch Chairman, Anya Hindmarch . 41 Brent Hoberman Founder, mydeco.com . 42 Cassie Hutchings CEO, GCH Capital . 43 Sir George Iacobescu Chairman and CEO, Canary Wharf . 44 Alan Jackson, Chairman, The Restaurant Group . 45 Peter Jackson, Former CEO, Travelex . 46 Nick Jenkins, Founder, Moonpig.com . 47 Neil Johnson, Chairman, E2V . 48 Luke Johnson, chairman, Risk Capital . 49 Richard Joseph, Co-founder, Joseph Joseph . 50 Ray Kelvin Founder and CEO, Ted Baker . 51 Nadir Lalani Founder and CEO, 99p Stores . 52 Ben Latham Jones Head of Ealing Studios . 53 Nick Leslau Chairman, Prestbury Investments . 54 Rhydian Lewis CEO, Ratesetter . 55 James Lipscombe MD and co-owner, The Chesterford . 56 Derek Lovelock, Chairman, Mamas and Papas . 57 Ron Mackintosh, Chairman, CSR . 58 Sir Cameron Mackintosh Founder, Cameron Mackintosh . 59 Edward Mellors, director, Mellors . 60 Tom Molnar CEO, Bread . 61 John Morgan, CEO, Morgan Sindall . 62 Matt Moulding, CEO, The Hut Group . 63 Stephen Murphy, Chairman, Wyevale Garden Centres . 64 Jonathan Neame CEO Shepherd Neame . 65 John Neill Chairman and CEO, Unipart . 66 Nick Newbury, CEO, Original Travel . 67 Jonathan Newhouse, Chairman & CEO, Conde Nast International . 68 Richard Nichols CEO, Instinctif Partners . 69 Mike Norris, CEO Computacenter . 71 Sir Dick Olver, Former chairman BAE Systems . 72 Alan Parker Chairman, Mothercare . 73 Tony Pidgley Chairman, Berkeley Group . 74 Thembalat Ramachandran, CEO&MD, Bristol Laboratories . 75 Nick Robertson Founder & CEO, ASOS . 76 Lord Rose Chairman, Ocado . 77 Richard Rose Executive chairman, Crawshaws . 78 Chrissie Rucker Founder, The White Company . 79 Sir Nigel Rudd, Chairman designate, Meggitt . 80 Rakesh Sharma CEO, Ultra Electronics . 81 Baroness Shields Chairman, Tech City . 82 Jasminder Singh Chairman and CEO, Edwardian Group . 83 Rob Templeman Chairman, RAC . 84 Tidjane Thiam, Group CEO, Prudential . 85 Sarah Thomson, Founder and CEO, Addictive Points . 86 Simon Townsend CEO, Enterprise Inns . 87 Michael Turner Chairman, Fullers, Smith & Turner . 88 Moni Varma, MD and Chairman, Veetee Rice . 89 Matthew Vaughn Owner, Marv Films . 90 Ollie Vigors, MD, Longshot Kids . 91 Robert Walker Chairman, Travis Perkins . 92 Malcolm Walker Founder, Iceland . 93 Paul Walsh Chairman, Compass . 94 James Wates Chairman, Wates . 95 George Weston CEO, Associated British Foods . 96 Nick Wheeler Founder, Charles Tyrwhitt . 97 Mike Wheeler MD, Auto Styling . 98 Charles Wigoder Executive chairman, Telecom Plus . 99 Paul Wilkinson Chairman,Thorntons . 100 Will Wyatt CEO, Caledonia Investments . 101 Sir Hossein Yassaie CEO, Imagination Technologies . 102 Steve Varley Chairman, UK&I, EY . 103 Richard Baker, Chairman, DFS .\n",

Not in memory of all the Oscar winners who walked it down the Hollywood years but for the bad blood soon to be spilt by the two greatest boxers in the world. Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao took this starry detour en route to their appointment with destiny in Las Vegas on May 2. The Academy Awards have outgrown the Nokia Theater now but this landmark still plays host to those who dream of immortality. Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao face-off at their Los Angeles press conference on Wednesday . Mayweather and Pacquiao pose ahead of trading verbal bards at the\u00a0Nokia Theater in Hollywood . Mayweather makes his way to the stage to occupy the same space as Pacquiao before they take to the ring . Mayweather addresses the massive crowd assembled under the bright lights to see the fighters . Pacquiao takes his turn at the podium to say his piece ahead of the blockbuster bout . Pac-Man is all smiles as he enters the arena that once hosted the glitzy Academy Awards . Click here for all that was said as Floyd Mayweather and May Pacquiao came face-to-face for their press conference ahead of their mega-fight on May 2 in Las Vegas . Ultimate stardom can bring out the best or worst in fighting men and Pacquiao had said that it would be good for boxing if can defeat Mayweather, who he sees as bloated with arrogance by success and wealth. So the man who calls himself Money presented himself in a quiet suit and a modest demeanour, speaking with admiration of his challenger as the best pound-for-pound man in the ring. Even though he does expect to win the richest fight of all time. And although he dubs himself The Best Ever, he was full of respect for the legends who preceded him in the lighter-to-middling weight divisions. \u2018When I saw Thomas Hearns versus Marvin Hagler I thought to myself there would never be a bigger fight, ever. They were great. Yet here we are today. Getting ready to make some history.\u2019 There was no trash-talking. Floyd said of Manny: \u2018It is all about the best fighting the best and Pacquiao is one of the best fighters of this era. 'He\u2019s a great fighter. To reach where he has in the sport of boxing, to be here now, he has to be doing something right. This is part of the fascination of this fight. Mayweather and Pacquiao separate after posing on stage for the sea of cameras . Lights. Camera. Action. The scene is set for the preamble to boxing's richest-ever fight on May 2 . Pacquiao\u2019s promoter Bob Arum (left) speaks on behalf of his star during the blockbuster promotion . Mayweather says he didn't think he'd see a bigger fight than Thomas Hearns versus Marvin Hagler. 'They were great. Yet here we are today. Getting ready to make some history.' \u2018I can always figure out an opponent instantly and I will have to do it again.\u2019 He also predicts \u2013 in addition to \u2018my emerging victorious yet again\u2019 \u2013 that this event will live up to it\u2019s gigantic hype. He says: \u2018I\u2019m excited. He\u2019s excited. It\u2019s gonna be exciting. This is a fight the world can't miss. It is an unbelievable match-up . \u2018Styles make fights. I\u2019m not psychic so I can\u2019t tell you exactly how it play out. But I can\u2019t wait. Manny is a very interesting fighter but I\u2019ve only seen him fight live twice in the last five years \u2013 I\u2019m more of a football and basketball fan these days \u2013 but I will find the key to Mr Pacquiao. Just as we\u2019ve beaten all the other top guys. 'He wants to win just the same way I want to win. But one thing I do know about any sport, when you lose its in your mind. If you\u2019ve lost once its in your mind, if you lost twice its in your mind.' Nor does he accept the widespread perception that, with him aged 38 and Pacquiao 36 \u2013 that the fight has come five years too late. He says: \u2018Everything is always in the timing. When we met each other for the first time at that basketball ball game the other night and then talked man to man in his hotel room, the time was right to make this fight. \u2018We\u2019ll see if we\u2019re too old. I feel good. I look forward to looking good.\u2019 Mayweather Jnr laughs for the cameras as he arrives for the press conference in Los Angeles . Pacquiao was also in a positive mood as he turned up looking sharp in a suit and tie . The 47-0 American champion is surrounded by sizeable security guards on the red carpet . Slick in shades, Pacquiao comfortably makes his way through a sea of photographers and well-wishers . Of his alleged vulnerability to southpaws, of which the Pac-Man is the prime example, Mayweather says: \u2018I\u2019m eight wins in a row against southpaws in my 47 victories to date. For me it\u2019s business as usual.\u2019 Pacquiao\u2019s promoter Bob Arum questioned that: \u2018When Floyd was with me Floyd Snr (his trainer and father) used to say, \"No Southpaws. No Southpaws\".\u2019 Nevertheless, Mayweather denied there had ever been serious differences between himself and Arum: 'There's never been animosity. It was just that the time had come for me to be my own promoter and to gain that experience.\u2019 While Mayweather talks of \u2018just continuing to do what we\u2019ve always done,\u2019 Pacquaio admits he has been preparing mentally for this during the seemingly ever-lasting negotiations. He says: \u2018It\u2019s been five years and I\u2019ve been thinking about it all that time. Running it through my mind. Now I can put all that to good use.\u2019 Always ready to put on a show, Mayweather enjoys himself in front of the photo board . Pacquiao poses with trainer Freddie Roach, with whom he's preparing for the fight at their Hollywood base . (From left) A model, promoter Bob Arum, Pacquiao and Roach show their fists for the cameras . Ring announcers Michael Buffer (left) and Jimmy Lennon are ready to see Mayweather and Pacquiao rumble . Pacquiao draws on that to sustain his own belief that he will win: \u2018I am 100 per cent confident I will win. In truth I was more worried about boxing Oscar De La Hoya \u2013 very good boxer \u2013 and Miguel Cotto and Antonio Margarito (both bigger men and very hard punchers) \u2013 than I am about this fight.\u2019 Equally well-dressed and just as courteous, Pacquiao stressed the importance of victory not only to himself but his country, where he is an elected Congressman: \u2018If you take a video camera to the Philippines on May 2 you will see that everyone in my country watching the fight \u2013 and their amazing reaction when I win.\u2019 Pacquiao added: 'I want to let the people know that God can raise someone from nothing to something - and that is me. I came from nothing to something and I owe everything to God.' Freddie Roach, meanwhile, said: 'This is the biggest challenge of my life and I've been looking forward to this for a long time. We are in the toughest fight of our lives, we are fighting the best fighter in the world. But we are going to kick his ass.' Mayweather has demanded, as is his custom, home advantage in his adopted city of Las Vegas. Mayweather and Pacquiao were joined on stage after the press conference by pop superstar Justin Bieber . But he insists there could be \u2018no better stage in the world\u2019 for an event of this magnitude. Ever the showman-cum-salesman, he set the scene perfectly: \u2018Lights, camera, action.\u2019 Those lights, cameras \u2013 and of course the music \u2013 then turned up to dazzling glare and deafening blast as they strode down the aisle of the Theater and onto the stage for the big-sell. This rehearsed razzamataz was beamed around the world via satellite by the two giant cable TV networks in America, who are sharing the $350 million to half-billion dollar bonanza. Arum put the size of the fight into coninput by saying: \u2018We are used to seeing events like the Olympics get this sort of attention but it rarely happens in boxing. Now Mayweather v Pacquiao will be watched by pretty much everyone in the world. These are two great fighters and what they are doing will be great for boxing.'\n",

Brendan Smith, from Perth in Western Australia, had landed in Johannesburg in South Africa just 36 hours before the vicious predator jumped through an open car window and attacked him. In a Facebook post, Mr Smith recalled the terrifying moment he was bitten, with a sense of humour. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING . Brendan Smith was on an African safari when he mauled by a lion who jumped through a window and bit him . 'No later than 36 hours after touching down in Africa I find myself in hospital after a lion jumped through the car window and decided to go to town on my legs,' he wrote. 'Pretty full-on but am alive, with insurance coming to the party and an influx of curious Africans wanting to see \"the lion man\". 'Could have and should have been a lot worse but chicks dig scars so I'll be sweet!' It is believed the Perth man was on safari near Johannesburg and was treated at the city's Fourways Life Hospital. Mr Smith (pictured with an unidentified friend) posted pictures of his wounds on Facebook with a recount of the horrifying attack . Mr Smith's wounds appear to be deep in graphic photos uploaded on his Facebook page. His post also included a picture of two female lions lazing on the grass. It is not known if these were the lions that attacked him. One of the pictures show what looks like teeth puncture marks which have broken through Mr Smith's skin. Looking at his page, Mr Smith appears to be an avid adventurer and traveller. The Perth man said he had escaped with his life and described the experience as 'pretty full-on' One of the pictures show what looks like teeth puncture marks which have broken through Mr Smith's skin . His photos show him skydiving, eating scorpions, jumping through fire hoops and shooting at a gun range. His dad, Brian Smith, said he was relieved to hear his son was safe. 'So glad it's not worse. Very lucky lad. You will be in pain for weeks,' Brian wrote on social media. 'I think u should cut your losses and get on the next plane home after hospital. Take care.' Friends also expressed their concern for the injured Australian by leaving messages of sympathy under his post. 'You are one lucky son of a b**** - sort of :-S hope you're on the mend dude and can enjoy the rest of your trip,' one friend wrote. Another well-wisher expressed their shock at the news. 'Oh my god! You have survived some pretty crazy travel adventures, but this takes the cake,' she said. 'Imagine this story at the pub in 40 years time. Sending you loads of love & well wishes xx.' Mr Smith was planning to continue on to a shark dive in Gansbaai - south of Cape Town - from his safari, but now he is unsure if his plans will still go ahead as he is in hospital.\n",

The baby, believed to be from an Asian family, suffered a serious head injury and died outside a semi-detached home in Yardley, Birmingham. Several neighbours have said they thought the owner of the truck may be the boy's father, a taxi driver, who was seen 'crying his eyes out' after the crash. An air ambulance landed in a public park opposite the house and paramedics made desperate efforts to save the baby after the 'tragic' crash earlier today. Floral tributes have been left at the scene of the incident in Birmingham where a one-year-old boy died after a\u00a0pick-up truck -thought to belong to his father - reversed into a garden wall which then collapsed on him . The boy suffered a serious head injury and died outside a semi-detached home in Yardley, Birmingham . Police were alerted at around 5pm and officers said the road was likely to be closed for some time for an investigation to take place. The family's next door neighbour Mary Mason, 67, said: 'The pick up truck is there quite often so I think it belongs to the home owner. 'I saw it reversing out my window and then it lurched forward and I heard a massive crash. I looked out and their garden wall had collapsed. 'Next thing I know I can just hear screaming and shouting, I don't know what was going on. There was chaos. I could just hear yelling and panicked screams. 'There was blue flashing lights everywhere but I had no idea what had happened, I thought the wall had just collapsed but the shouting and the noise made me think it could have been something worse.'

'But I'm certain he must have been on the footpath the other side of their garden wall. I looked out my window and could see the man crying his eyes out - he was a mess, he was really in a bad way.' A white forensic tent was erected outside the \u00a3120,000 semi-detached property where the crash took place and a large number of people could be inside one of the nearby homes. Neighbour Barbara Porter, 76, said: 'I heard the helicopter land in Old Yardley Park over the road and there was police and ambulances everywhere. 'Its a really busy road and we've had loads of accidents down here. To know it is a little child is just heartbreaking. 'There's a lot of pedestrians as we are by a school and the cars are always bombing down the road. It's such a shame. 'It doesn't get more tragic than this. It's upsetting to think about what his family must be going through right now.' Another neighbour\u00a0Glenys Cooper, 68, said: 'I went out after hearing a lot of commotion. There were sirens blaring. 'I spoke to one woman who was in a right state, she was really upset and she said it was her cousin who had been involved. 'But she couldn't get to anywhere near the scene really, the police soon had it all taped off. It's such a tragedy. Paramedics and an emergency doctor made desperate efforts to save the baby and\u00a0Northamptonshire Air Ambulance attended the scene . Officers were called to the Stechford area of the city at around 5pm today following a report that a recovery truck had hit a wall, pictured is the road where the incident took place .

'Specialist officers will be supporting the boy's family and \u2013 as with all serious and fatal collisions - an investigation has been launched to establish the cause.' Dozens of people have already taken to social media to send messages of support to the baby's family, who are believed to be from the area.

The minister, known for being a prosperity preacher at his Atlanta-area World Changers Church International, is seeking \"200,000 people committed to sow $300 or more (to) help achieve our goal to purchase the G650 airplane.\" The figures were presented Friday in a nearly six-minute video on the Creflo Dollar Ministries website and total more than $60 million needed to buy the Gulfstream G650, which goes for a reported $65 million. The page featuring the video and information on the fundraiser has been taken down, but those wishing to donate are still able to do so on the church's gift page. The project isn't limited to member donations, as the site states that \"we are asking members, partners and supporters of this ministry to assist us in acquiring a Gulfstream G650.\" The request goes on to detail that the luxury jet will transport Pastors Creflo and Taffi Dollar and member of the Dollars' church around the globe to help them spread the gospel. Prosperity gospel is a theology that promises wealth and health to those who tithe 10% of their income to the church. The video includes parishioners, a pilot, a project manager and even the President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, advocating on behalf of the pastor. On the video, the pastor chronicles incidents involving his current jet, which has been in service for more than three decades: The right engine went out en route to Australia, but the plane was able to safely land at its destination thanks to the experience of the pilot and crew. During another trip, mechanical failure caused the jet to skid off a runway in London while Taffi Dollar and their three daughters were aboard. Dollar attributed his family's safe arrival to \"a grace working on that airplane, that brought my girls back home to me, you understand what I am saying?\" he said from the pulpit to thunderous applause. Dollar said that after those incidents, he \"knew that it was time to begin to believe God for a new airplane.\" The Gulfstream G650 would comfortably allow the ministry make its way around the world. It seats up to 14 passengers with berthing for six, according to gulfstream.com. The jet comes with two Rolls-Royce engines, high-speed Internet and two multichannel satellites and allows for a four-and-a-half-hour commute from New York to Los Angeles. \"The G650 is the biggest, fastest, most luxurious, longest range and most technologically advanced jet -- by far,\" according to the site. In soliciting the donations, Dollar's site states, \"We need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ. Your love gift of any amount will be greatly appreciated.\" Attempts to contact Dollar's ministry for comment were unsuccessful.\n",

Wales winger Bale was targeted along with coach Carlo Ancelotti after they arrived back in Madrid following the 2-1 defeat at the Nou Camp. The government's anti-violence in sport commission imposed the fines as well as a six-month ban from sports installations, the commission said on Thursday. Gareth Bale's car was attacked by angry Real Madrid fans following their 2-1 defeat by Barcelona on Sunday . The world's most expensive footballer was confronted by fans as he left the club's Valdebebas training base . The \u00a386million signing's white Bentley is struck by this fan while others jeered Wales international Bale . The fan tries to give the car a kick as Bale pulls away and the abuse continues to be thrown his way in Spain . Real said on Monday one of the three men had been identified as a member and had been suspended and banned from their facilities pending a disciplinary hearing on whether to expel him from the club. Bale\u00a0was accosted driving away from the club's training ground in the early hours of Monday morning. Two men tried to stop Bale, kicking out at his car as he sped away from them without stopping. The men shouted 'Hijo de puta' ('Son of a bitch') at the player as security guards attempted to calm them down. Bale's team-mates Jese and Sergio Ramos were also targeted. Bale has been singled out by Real supporters since the turn of the year as the team have lost three games in the league. On Monday, Real announced that the offending member's identity has been sent to the club's discipline commission with the request for him to be expelled from the Santiago Bernabeu outfit for the 'very serious offence.' In addition the club say that they will take applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for the incident. Bale and his Madrid team-mates lost 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Sunday night in a fiercely-contested El Clasico . An estimated 400 million people watched Bale struggle on television as Real moved four points behind Barca . On their official club website, Real Madrid's statement read: 'Following the incidents that occurred involving three individuals in the early hours of this morning outside Ciudad Real Madrid, Real Madrid C. F. wishes to outline the following: . 1.- The Club has already identified the individuals responsible, one a Real Madrid member, for these aggressive and violent actions against several of our players. 2.- Details of this member's identity were sent to the Club's Discipline Commission, requesting that it expel the individual from Real Madrid for what is considered a very serious offence. 3.- This afternoon, the Discipline Commission held an emergency meeting and decided to open a disciplinary investigation and provisionally suspend the individual's rights as a member and access to the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u or any Real Madrid facilities. 4.- Real Madrid has notified Spain's National Anti-Violence Commission of the incidents that took place, as well as the identities of the individuals responsible, requesting that it apply those sanctions that it considers appropriate. 5.- Furthermore, Real Madrid will take any applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for these incidents.' Spanish newspaper\u00a0AS\u00a0refused to give Bale a mark in their ratings for the Barca defeat, while Marca\u00a0wrote: 'It's obvious [president Florentino] Perez has paid\u00a0\u20ac100m for someone worth \u20ac20m.'

Bale was unlucky not to score at the Nou Camp in front of an estimated 400 million watchers on television as his first-half goal was ruled out for Cristiano Ronaldo being offside. The Wales international, despite helping Madrid win the Copa del Rey and Champions League by scoring in both finals last season, has found life difficult in Spain this year. Bale scored both goals in a 2-0 win against Levante less than two weeks ago, and celebrated ending his 829-minute drought by covering his ears as if to block out the criticism. The corner flag received a kicking from the 25-year-old, too, as he let out his frustration. It came after the former Tottenham Hotspur winger was whistled at his own stadium last month and a fan poll found 40 per cent of supporters wanted Bale to be dropped by manager Carlo Ancelotti. Bale has been linked with moves to Manchester United and Chelsea previously, with the majority of Madrid fans seemingly hoping he decides to return to the Barclays Premier League.

        "input": "Sixty three seconds was all it took. Just over one minute was enough for a game to be turned on its head and for refereeing standards to be demonstrated, once again, to be lamentable. To deal with the first part of that conundrum, referee Neil Swarbrick can\u2019t really be blamed for the game ending as a spectacle before it had even got going. Gareth McAuley and Craig Dawson got themselves in a terrible tangle, the former with a sloppy pass and the latter clumsily challenging Wilfried Bony, who was through on goal. The red card was justifiable and the challenge was a bone-headedly stupid one to make in the first minute. The real drama occurred thereafter, however. Bony, to his credit, attempted to go on and score. McAuley, attempting to redeem his error, ran round to challenge the Ivorian and make a good challenge to block him. Referee Neil Swarbrick shows a red card to Gareth McAuley (right) during the second minute of West Brom's match at Manchester City. But it was Craig Dawson who committed the original foul on Wilfried Bony as the striker tried to break through on goal . West Brom defender Craig Dawson makes the original challenge on Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony just outside the penalty area . The Ivorian striker heads to the ground under Dawson's clumsy challenge but managed to regain his balance and continue . Bony continues but Gareth McAuley then comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area . Bony goes to ground again under McAuley's challenge, leading to the dismissal of the West Brom player . Bony heads to the Etihad Stadium turf after being challenged by McAuley as the ball runs clear . Swarbrick brandishes a straight red card to a bemused McAuley after just 89 seconds of the match . West Brom players Darren Fletcher and Jonas Olsson protest as Swarbrick shows McAuley the red card . BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him . Baggies boss Tony Pulis doesn't look at McAuley as he makes his way back to the dressing rooms at the Etihad Stadium . As this sign at the Etihad Stadium confirms, McAuley's sending off was the fastest in the Premier League this season at 89 seconds . West Brom players (from left) Craig Gardner, James Morrison and Darren Fletcher argue with Swarbrick at half-time .

Click here for our match zone service . In the midst of all that, Swarbrick blew up for a foul from where Dawson had made the initial challenge. But instead of sending off the left back he dismissed McAuley. In one year the Premier League has now seen three cases of the wrong man being sent off. Either referees are getting worse, or the game is getting immeasurably faster. And with rugby\u2019s Six Nations tournament reaching a climax yesterday, you longed for a brief pause in which the referee could consult a fourth official who could adjudicate on the red card \u2013 he would have probably concurred \u2013 and then ensure the right man is sent off. Tony Pulis naturally agreed with that, arguing managers should have the ability to challenge two decisions in a match, citing the fact that in other games Dawson\u2019s challenge might have gone unpunished. \u2018The inconsistency is one thing,\u2019 he said. \u2018But once he decides it\u2019s a goal-scoring opportunity and he has to send him of I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s picked the wrong player. It\u2019s beyond me. Pellegrini\u2019s assessment was about correct. \u2018He made a mistake about the player but I think the rule is very clear,\u2019 he said. \u2018The chance was very clear and he was the last man. Then it doesn\u2019t depend on the referee \u2013 he has to do what the rule says.\u2019 Naturally the match felt unnaturally uncompetitive thereafter and that seemed to be reflected in the crowd. The atmosphere at City after a week of defeats to Burnley and Barcelona was as muted as could be. Technically they are still in the title race; in fact they are only three points behind, albeit Chelsea have two games in hand. But judging from the mood at The Etihad yesterday, that is merely a theoretical, abstract concept. All belief seems to have been sucked out of the club, meaning that all that is left is a top-four finish to oversee before Pellegrini is thanked for his time and his two trophies. Wilfried Bony celebrates after scoring Manchester City's first goal after 25 minutes at the Etihad Stadium . The Ivorian striker opened his account for the club when he spun inside the box, hooked the ball over and fired into the net . Fernando gets down on his knees to celebrate scoring City's second goal five minutes before half-time . The Brazilian pounced from close range following Baggies defensive confusion, with goalkeeper Boaz Myhill grounded . David Silva (centre) is congratulated after scoring City's third goal to make absolutely sure of the three points . Silva raises his arms in celebration after touching in a shot by Stevan Jovetic from the edge of the penalty box . There was a brief spell in which you wondered if Pellegrini\u2019s woes might get worse should they fail to break down ten-man West Brom. But the visitors, Boaz Myhill aside, weren\u2019t in the mood for gritty defiance. Indeed, it seemed as though the entire fiasco had collectively scrambled their defensive brains. The first two goals they conceded, which made their task hopeless both came from corners, situations at which they should be able to defend more easily than from open play. But for the first goal on 26 minutes, City worked the ball well from a short corner to Wilfried Bony. Craig Gardner attempted a half hearted challenge but Bony was not to be shrugged off the ball and pulled it down; the unfortunate Dawson was also culpable, not reacting quick enough as the Ivorian controlled, shot and scored his first goal for the club since his \u00a328m move. West Brom might have felt a little more aggrieved for the second goal on 40 minutes \u2013 though it too involved some dreadful defending. Jesus Navas corner was met by the high, flying foot of Eliaquim Managala and it seemed perilously close to Stephane Sessegnon\u2019s head. That said, from thereon in, West Brom hardly covered themselves in glory. Jonas Olsson sliced the ball gently into the path of Fernando and James Morrison failed to react as the Brazilian simply poked the ball into the net. Joe Hart collides with West Brom defender Jonas Olsson as he comes out to try and punch the ball clear . Joleon Lescott leaps in behind Pablo Zabaleta but sends the ball over Joe Hart's goal following a rare West Brom attack . Saido Berahino somehow hit the crossbar with this header, with Joe Hart nowhere near it . \u2018I think our fans believe we can do it,\u2019 said Pellegrini. \u2018The important thing is to demonstrate playing the way we did today that we will try. That is very important.\u2019 That they did, with 46 shots on goal. But it\u2019s not enough to sustain credibility at present. There was a brief spell in which you wondered if Pellegrini\u2019s woes might get worse should they fail to break down ten-man West Brom.

Craig Gardner attempted a half-hearted challenge but Bony was not to be shrugged off the ball and pulled it down; and the unfortunate Dawson was also culpable, not reacting quick enough as the Ivorian controlled, shot and scored his first goal for the club since his \u00a328m move. The England under 21 striker can't quite believe his luck after seeing his header rebound off the woodwork . Frank Lampard rues a missed opportunity as City attempted to boost their goal difference - settling for three in the end . Man City striker Stevan Jovetic appeals to referee Swarbrick for a handball decision . Were it not for Myhill the afternoon would have been even more calamitous. His most notable saves came from David Silva on 23 minutes, 54 minutes and 59 minutes but that was by no means an exhaustive list. West Brom were also saved on 58 minutes by the post when Sergio Aguero struck and then again by the woodwork, when Bony chipped the rebound on to the cross bar. On 73 minutes there was an extraordinary development; a West Brom corner, which was flicked on by Olsson to Berahino, who, just two yards out, flicked an instinctive header on to the bar. The miss summed up a dismal afternoon. Shortly afterwards, Silva, by far the best player on the pitch, confirmed the inevitable. Stevan Jovetic combined well with the rampaging Gael Clichy and the Montenegrin\u2019s shot was turned in at close range by Silva, who departed shortly after to a standing ovation. Still, the overwhelming feeling from both sides was of a season gently winding down rather than reaching a dramatic climax.

Up against 10 men for 88 minutes, City won easily thanks to Bony, Fernando and David Silva . Ivorian striker Bony scored his first goal for the club with a neat spin and finish on 25 minutes .

        "input": "She's as well-known for her stunning figure as she is for her chart-topping hits so it's perhaps no surprise that American songstress Taylor Swift is reported to be insuring her legs for a cool \u00a326.5million. Grammy-winning Taylor, 25, attributes a huge slice of her global success to her energetic stage performances and her team have apparently looked into how much it would cost to insure her legs against potential career-threatening accidents. The Pennsylvania-raised star is embarking upon a global tour in May and the move is said to be a precaution against such a physically-demanding schedule. Scroll down for video . Diamonds in those heels: Taylor Swift's super-slim legs have reportedly been insured for a whopping \u00a326.5million ahead of her gruelling world tour which begins in May . Prized assets: Taylor's pins, on display (left) at the Saturday Night Live anniversary special last month, are considered a key part of her high-energy stage performances. Showing them off at a pre-Grammy Gala in LA in February (right) The Blank Space singer is reported to have said she was 'embarrassed' at how much her slender limbs are said to be worth. Celebrity insurers Lloyd's, which has specialised in offering body-part policies since the 1930s, said they were not surprised by the vast sums attributed to Taylor's pins. Underwriter Jonathan Thomas told FEMAIL: 'Taylor Swift\u2019s income-generating capacity is hugely dependent upon her stage presence and thus her exceptional legs are indeed very likely worth millions of dollars of insurance.' She's certainly not the first celebrity to insure herself, however, with a whole host of other stars on record for ensuring their prize assets, which they often consider the key to their success, are protected by policy. Long before Kim Kardashian's derriere arrived on the scene, Jennifer Lopez famously insured her perfectly-round bottom for millions of dollars. Australian singer Kylie Minogue, whose rear grabbed the headlines in gold hotpants in the video for hit single Spinning Around back in 2000 was said to have insured her behind shortly after to the tune of \u00a33million. That booty! J-Lo (left) was the original doyenne of the derriere and is said to have a \u00a317million premium protecting her bottom. Kylie Minogue (right) has a similar policy, worth \u00a33million . Dolly Parton is as well-known for her 40DD chest as she is for her back-catalogue of country music hits and is alleged to have once insured them for \u00a33.8million - or \u00a31.9million each. Bruce Springsteen's relentless live dates contribute hugely to his overall fortune so he needs more than the price of honey and lemon to keep his voice safe - the vocal chords of 'the Boss' are covered for up to \u00a33million. For obvious reasons, sports stars can also have high premiums attached to certain parts of their anatomies. Although it's common practice for football clubs to insure against injury, a career-threatening tackle on a higher-profile star could potentially lose the club millions in sponsorship deals. In 2006, it was revealed that David Beckham had insured his cross-whipping legs against injury for around \u00a3100million while playing for Paris Saint-Germain. While in 2013, Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo's club Real Madrid renewed their insurance for his lightning-quick legs at a cost estimated to be around \u00a374million. Legs eleven: When David Beckham was competing at a professional level, his goal-scoring limbs had a whopping \u00a3100million price tag on them. The Boss, aka Bruce Springsteen, is so protective of his lucrative voice that he's insured it for \u00a33million . No need for a stuntman: 007 star Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own action scenes in the 2008 Bond film Quantam of Solace...at a cost of \u00a35million in insurance . In 2008, Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own stunts for Bond film Quantam of Solace. 'He does a lot more than Pierce used to do,' said the film's chief stunt coordinator Gary Powell at the time, '...and he's allowed to because he's capable of doing it. He thinks, \"You're paying to see me, and that's me doing it.\" He wants the audience to know.' It might have given the film's makers a headache though, for such daredevilry came at an eye-watering insurance price, said to be \u00a35million. A head for business: The Only Way is Essex star Joey said last year that he would insure his perfectly coiffured hair for \u00a31million...shortly after launching his D:Reem range of hair products for Tesco . Good golly, Miss Dolly: Country star Ms Parton has protected her surgically-enhanced bosom for \u00a33.8million while trailing in her wake is reality tv star Holly Madison, who has a similar chest-protecting policy for \u00a366,000 . Million-dollar smile, literally. Film actress Julia Roberts was the subject of an insurance policy that saw her pearly whites covered for just shy of \u00a320million . Becoming savvy about protecting career-boosting parts of the body isn't a new phenomenon. As early as the 1930s celebrities became aware of how much certain bits of them can influence their success. Specialist insurers Lloyd\u2019s say the entertainment industry developing in California in the early 20th century quickly appreciated just how much a film could gross if its central star's appearance was just right. Early film stars such as Cyd Charisse\u2019s (legs) and Jimmy Durante (nose) chose the company to provide them with policies. Present-day clients include burlesque star Holly Madison\u2019s breasts and NFL player Troy Polamalu\u2019s hair.\n",

But the mayor and police chief may have been less than impressed by the lack of Black and Minority Ethnic candidates on the parade ground. Having set an ambitious target of having 40 per cent of all officers from Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds, only 18 per cent met that criteria. Some 219 new police officers joined the ranks of the Metropolitan Police after today's Passing Out Parade . More than one-third of the recruits who graduated from the Police Training College in Hendon were women . Of the new officers, 18 per cent are from Black or Minority Ethnic backgrounds, according to new figures . Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, left and Mayor Boris Johnson, right, both attended the ceremony . Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe both attended today's ceremony and praised the growing number of non-white officers within the force, despite missing their own diversity target by more than 50 per cent. Only 39 of the 216 officers graduating from Hendon Police Training College were from BME backgrounds, despite the Metropolitan Police accepting that at least 40 per cent - or 86 officers should have been from non-white backgrounds. According to a report published by the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee in December 2014, before the most recent recruitment campaign, only 11 per cent of officers serving in the Met were from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic background, compared with approximately 40 per cent of the population of London. The current BME figure in the Met is now 12 per cent. Only three per cent of female officers with the Met are from minority backgrounds. Mayor Johnson today said that the number of BME officers in the Met has increased to 12 per cent. In an effort to boost BME numbers in the force, the Metropolitan Police is only considering applications from candidates who live within the Greater London area. The Metropolitan Police has set an ambitious target of recruiting 40 per cent of officers from BME backrounds . Only 12 per cent of officers serving with the Met are currently from a BME background . Since this policy has been introduced, 35 per cent of people who have expressed an interest in joining the Met have been from a BME background. Mayor Johnson said: 'London is one of the most diverse cities in the world and we are now beginning to see the creation of a police force that truly reflects the city that it serves. 'By taking tough decisions on the budget, we've been able to recruit additional officers and put more of them out on the streets, driving down crime and keeping Londoners safe. 'There's more to be done but with more officers from every community in the capital, using the best technology we can provide, I believe we are well on the way to creating the force we need to tackle 21st century crime and protect London for years to come.' Deputy Director of Training Superintendent Robyn Williams, left, inspected the new recruits . The new recruits have boosted the strength of the Met to almost 32,000 despite significant budget pressure .

Heather Mack and her 21-year-old boyfriend Tommy Schaefer were in court accused of murdering Heather's mother, Sheila Von Wiese-Mack in a plush Bali hotel last August and then stuffing her body in a suitcase. The Prosecution at Denpasar District Court also want Schaefer to be sentenced to 18 years in jail and tears rolled down his face when he heard the news through an interpreter. Scroll down for video . Heather Mack smiles at her baby daughter Stella before her sentencing hearing in Denpasar, Bali, today . Mack wept as prosecutors said she should be sentenced to 15 years - but spared her the death penalty . There was a rare glimpse of baby Stella's face as she was carried from Bali's Kerobokan prison to court . Her co-accused, boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, was seen clutching his baby daughter for the first time today . The 21-year-old from Chicago also cried as translators relayed the news that prosecutors want him to serve an 18-year sentence over the death of Mack's mother,\u00a0Sheila Von Wiese-Mack . 19-year-old Mack, looking at her child, was told she had 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother', but the prosecutors said they had been 'lenient as she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby' A teary and nervous looking Mack puffed on a cigarette as she waited to hear what sentence would be demanded by the prosecutor . Mack was told by the chief prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya she had 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother', but was spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby'. Since being held in jail, the 19-year-old from Chicago has been keeping her 15-day old baby, Stella, with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison. In a bizarre comment from her holding cell today, Mack said with a grin that Stella has six fingers on her left hand, saying: 'But don't worry, she's OK, thank you.' As she waited in the cell, nervously puffing on a cigarette, Mack added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married 'in spirit'. She said: 'He has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison. She held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring. 'Tommy's is blue,' she added. It will now be up to the defence team to try to get the sentence reduced, or even thrown out. The court will resume next week when the defence begins its case. Jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime. A teary Mack hears the prosecution case today and her and Schaefer's defence lawyers will begin their arguments to have the sentence reduced - or the case thrown out - next week . The 19-year-old from Chicago looks glum and downbeat as she cradles baby Stella in a holding cell . Schaefer, 21, bows his head in the dock - he\u00a0has admitted killing his girlfriend's 62-year-old mother, battering her to death with the metal handle from a heavy fruit bowl . The 21-year-old gazes at his baby daughter, held by a relative, before his sentence demand hearing . Schaefer was spotted gently holding his baby daughter, Stella, for the first time today in his holding cell . Mack has said she never wanted her mother to die, but 'panicked' after her boyfriend attacked her in the hotel . Mack looked protective of her young daughter as she was greeted by a scrum of photographers at court . Mack claimed her daughter - who had to return to hospital shortly after her birth with jaundice - has six fingers on her left hand . Dressed in matching orange waistcoats, the couple are escorted by a court officer to the courtroom . Schaefer has admitted hitting the victim with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the boot of a taxi they had ordered. The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit. They tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel - and Mack was allegedly the only person who had permission to open the box. Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel. Mack, who said during an earlier court hearing that she did not wish her mother dead, said they panicked after Schaefer\u2019s attack with the metal bowl. She said they thought about\u00a0either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the US Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. When the prison gates opened today to take the couple, who are separated inside, to the court, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella - the first time he had been seen with her . 'Everything to live for': Mack and her boyfriend Schaefer (holding Stella) have been spared the death penalty . Mack has revealed that she is breast-feeding baby Stella in prison rather than give her formula milk . The child has lived in her mother's prison cell, despite hygiene concerns, since being treated for jaundice . The requested sentences of 15 and 18 years for Mack and her boyfriend have surprised many osbervers for their leniency . Shortly after the baby's birth Mack was being accused by prison sources of failing to wash the child properly . Mack has been keeping the baby with her in her crowded prison since the child was born this month . Polydactyly is a medical term used to describe extra fingers on the hands or toes on the feet. The extra fingers or toes may be small and non-functional, or they may be fully formed with bones and joints. Extra digits can exist in different places on the hands and feet. Extra digits can also be located in the centre of the hand or foot, and people with polydactyly often have extra digits on both hands or feet. Polydactyly occurs when the body follows a different set of directions than usual while forming the hands or feet during development. It is inhertited and can be passed on by just one parent if they have the disorder. Researchers are still discovering the genes that cause extra digits. But the trait may exist as part of a syndrome, which is a group of several recognisable clinical features that often occur together. Source: National Institutes of Health . When the prison gates opened today to take the couple - who are separated inside - to the court, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella as it was the first time he had been seen with her. After arriving at court, it was Mack who held the baby when she and her boyfriend emerged from the prison van. They were led to separate holding cells and Mack sat at the rear of hers with her arms wrapped around the baby, who was covered in a white shawl. She was observed breastfeeding the baby under the garment. The child was then handed to Schaefer, who lowered his face to her head and began tenderly kissing his daughter. 'He looked every part like the doting father,' said a photographer. 'It was the kind of scene you'd see anywhere in a playground for example - but he was behind bars. 'It seemed a bit strange to be seeing something like that.' Mack said she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years. A woman looking after the couple claim they were not using the child as a way to sway judges' feelings. The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice. The child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother. A woman looking after the couple claim they were not using the child to sway judges' feelings . A friend admitted that the appearance of the child would help to support the couple's insistence that they had a reason to be allowed to live . The baby had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice . The couple sported his-and-hers plastic and coloured rings, made by Schaefer in prison . The hearing will now move onto the next stage - when the argument is put forward by the defence. It is estimated that it will be at least a month before the judges make the final decision on whether the pair are guilty. Mack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women - until the child is two years old. She revealed there was another prison baby, aged seven months, in a separate cell.\n",

Installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago, \u00a31million-per-year O\u2019Neill and his assistant Keane, with a \u00a3600,000 salary, were given a remit of qualification for Euro 2016, a task made easier by the expansion to a 24-team format. Defeat against Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday evening, however, would all but end hope of automatic progression to the finals in France, leaving Ireland to do battle with Scotland for the play-off berth. The mood here is not optimistic. Martin O'Neill, manager of the Republic of Ireland, needs to prove his worth with victory over Poland . O'Neill and Roy Keane (left) were given big salaries and asked to reach the 2016 European Championships . An inquest, you feel, awaits O\u2019Neill and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders. One newspaper described their manager as \u2018bookish and vaguely befuddled\u2019, and noted the \u2018carnage\u2019 which follows Keane. There has been a definite effort to play down the chaos around Keane this week and the No 2 gave an untypically subdued and low-key performance in front of the press. O\u2019Neill ignored the opinion pieces which have called into question his impact since he arrived and kept all talk to football. He said: \u2018The importance of the occasion should not be missed. Defeat would be a big dent in our hopes of automatic qualification. It might not decide everything, but it is very significant. We have to try to win. If the Republic of Ireland fail to beat Poland, their hopes of automatic qualification will be all but over . O'Neill and Keane take a training session at Gannon Park as the team prepare for Sunday's big match . \u2018I\u2019ve said all along that the home games will shape our destiny. This is the first of that group. We have to make them count. \u2018We can change all of that (negative talk) with one result and one fantastic performance. We will not get very far with a pessimistic approach and I\u2019m not overly concerned with what people say before the game. \u2018We have given ourselves a chance (of qualification) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match.\u2019 One criticism of O\u2019Neill is that he does not know his preferred XI or, indeed, formation. He said this week that players could win a starting place should they impress at their coastal training base in Malahide. Keane hands out instructions to the Republic of Ireland players during a training session . Sunday's game takes place at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin; the Republic of Ireland's home ground . One player not guaranteed to start is captain Robbie Keane. He was dropped for the morale-shattering 1-0 defeat in Scotland in November. The LA Galaxy striker, 34, said: \u2018That\u2019s up to the manager (if I play). \u2018I\u2019ll be ready whether that\u2019s from the bench or starting. I\u2019m the captain, I have to set an example. \u2018But I wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t think I could make a difference. I still want to be the best. I have that hunger.\u2019 Keane, sensing the air of negativity, added: \u2018It\u2019s up to us to make this a turning point. Victory would give this squad and country a huge confidence boost.\u2019 Lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for O\u2019Neill before they host Scotland.

        "input": "Millions of ducks raised for the dinner table are being denied essentials like a pond to swim and bathe in, warns the RSPCA. The charity is calling on families to boycott duck meat until farmers and supermarkets implement dramatic improvements to the way the birds are treated. It says the reality for the 14.3m ducks reared for meat in the UK every year is very different from the Beatrix Potter and Jemima Puddle-duck view of farm life. Scroll down for video . Poor conditions: Ducks are often crammed into barns in their thousands in the semi-darkness without water to swim in . In fact, most are reared in barns, where thousands of birds are crammed together in semi-darkness, and they never get a chance to get their feet wet, let alone swim around. The RSPCA said not one of these ducks are raised according to the minimum welfare standards it supports under its \u2018Freedom Food\u2019 scheme and it is demanding new laws to improve conditions. However, producers insist there is no need to provide ponds as ducks \u2018have a low motivation to swim for any length of time\u2019. A survey by the RSPCA found most consumers have no idea how the ducks are raised and most would be appalled that they do not get access to water to swim and bathe in. Calling for action: The RSPCA wants conditions to improve for the millions of ducks reared for meat in the UK . There are no legal requirements to provide farmed ducks with anything other than water to drink, and the duck industry\u2019s own standards, through the Red Tractor scheme, only require ducks to be able to cover their heads with water. Welfare expert at the RSPCA, Dr Marc Cooper, said: \u2018Ducks are waterfowl, therefore they should be provided with water that allows them full body access. This is not only good for their health, as it helps keep their eyes, nostrils and feathers clean, but it also allows them to do the things they naturally want to do. \u2018It is disheartening that we are in a situation where the vast majority of farmed ducks are not provided with full body access to water. \u2018We want consumers to know the facts about how farmed ducks have been reared, and we want the industry to take on board the evidence within the report and help improve the lives of millions of ducks.\u2019 A YouGov survey for the RSPCA found that four in ten parents are likely to take children to a local pond or lake to feed the ducks. Yet the vast majority - 93 per cent - were unaware that it is not a legal requirement for farmed ducks to have bathing water they can get into. There are no legal requirements to provide farmed ducks with anything other than water to drink, and the duck industry\u2019s own standards only require ducks to be able to cover their heads with water . Some 78 per cent were \u2018appalled\u2019 that ducks farmed for their meat may never get access to bathing water. A new RSPCA report calls on shoppers to stop buying the meat until improvements are made. It warns: \u2018It is very difficult for consumers to find any meat from ducks reared to welfare standards the RSPCA would find acceptable. \u2018So unless they can be confident that this is the case, they are strongly encourage to avoid buying duck meat due to welfare concerns associated with poorer rearing conditions.\u2019 \u2018Unfortunately current UK law does not require water to be provided to ducks for anything other than drinking, and ducks may only have access to water from drinkers such as nipple drinkers. \u2018We believe the law should be changed so that producers are legally required to provide farmed ducks with suitable open water facilities that allow them fully body access.\u2019 The British Poultry Council said ducks do not need water to swim and bathe in and it is not practical for farmers to provide it. The organisation claimed ducks \u2018have a low motivation to swim for any length of time\u2019. British favourite: The RSPCA have called on shoppers to stop buying the meat until improvements are made . It has set up a Duck Assurance Scheme (DAS) to cover rearing policies and ensures there is enough water to allow the ducks to dip their heads in and use the water to preen their feathers. The BPC said the standards used by the RSPCA \u2018have been drawn up by a working group lacking in any practical experience of growing ducks on a commercial scale\u2019. It said: \u2018It is not practical to provide deep water for swimming - especially in indoor systems- and ducks do have a low motivation to swim for any length of time. \u2018Open water sources, particularly those in which ducks can get in, have poor water quality which can lead to bacterial infections of the eyes and nostrils. Keeping eyes, nostrils, feet and plumage clean is key to good duck health and welfare and is provided for the form of open water resource in the DAS. \u2018The DAS requires that ducks must have sufficient space to be able to sit without interference from other birds, to exhibit normal behaviour, to bathe, and have access to wholesome feed and clean fresh drinking water. \u2018DAS standards are built on science and are regularly reviewed and amended where new research supports good practice in the industry.\u2019\n",

He said the headlines had caused his own family - including his elderly father - to question him. 'I was most concerned for my wife, and my children, and for my father,' he told the court, glancing out to the body of the courtroom, where his wife Melissa Babbage sat staring straight ahead, her heels crossed.

The Canberra Times used another headline. The stories examined a political fundraising body in Mr Hockey's electorate known as the North Sydney Forum, where members who paid an annual fee were able to meet with the treasurer at special events. Joe Hockey, pictured with his wife Melissa Babbage, revealed the distress an article caused his family whilst appearing in court on Monday . Mr Hockey has told the court he first became aware of the articles when he received a phone call from his press secretary shortly after midnight on May 5, 2014. When he awoke a few hours later he headed straight for his local newsagency in Canberra. 'I saw the front pages, I was stunned. And Matt the newsagent said, 'What's all this about?' I just shook my head,' Mr Hockey said. 'I went across to the bakery for one of their very ordinary cups of coffee and looked around, and the papers were everywhere.'

So, to settle the argument of which is the greatest Premier League XI since it started in 1992-93, Sportsmail has studied every PFA team of the year to find out which players are most highly-regarded by their peers. The results are fascinating \u2013 and surprising in some cases too. Legendary Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel was selected in only one PL all-star team (1993), as was Dennis Bergkamp (1998) and therefore are well short of being considered for the greatest XI. Peter Schmeichel famously saves a penalty from Dennis Bergkamp in 1999... but neither make the all-time XI . Eric Cantona and Paul Scholes weren't voted for often enough either while Gianfranco Zola \u2013 regarded as one of the best players in Chelsea's history \u2013 was never picked in a PFA side. Roy Keane and Frank Lampard were picked on fewer occasions than central midfield rivals Steven Gerrard and Patrick Vieira. Likewise, stars like Luis Suarez and Gareth Bale performed too briefly on the Premier League stage to be chosen as often as other players. Based on the number of times they were voted for by their fellow professionals in the PFA Premier team of the season, here is the best XI over the last 23 years. And for Gerrard, heavily criticised after his red card against Manchester United on Sunday, there is some good news \u2013 nobody has been picked more often. THE PREMIER LEAGUE ALL TIME XI . EDWIN VAN DER SAR (PFA Team 2007, 2009, 2011) Played in Premier League for: Fulham, Manchester United . Sir Alex Ferguson compared the Dutchman's influence with Peter Schmeichel's after he helped Manchester United return to the top following a period of dominance by Jose Mourinho's Chelsea. Van der Sar was 34 when he joined United from Fulham but it proved to be a master signing, and one that Ferguson admitted he wished he'd made earlier. Van der Sar won three league titles in a row and was the hero of United's penalty shootout win against Chelsea in the 2008 Champions League final, making the match-winning save from Nicolas Anelka. Edwin van der Sar celebrates with his Manchester United team-mates after beating Chelsea in May 2011 . GARY NEVILLE (1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2005, 2007) Played for: Manchester United . The heart of Manchester United's team that dominated English football for two decades and part of the 1999 Treble-winning side. Neville was United's effective leader and club captain off the field well before he eventually wore the armband on it. The right-back for United and England was the most voiceferous member of the famed Class of 92 and since retirement has become a hugely influential figure both as a television pundit and England coach . Gary Neville was a stalwart of the Manchester United side and was named six times in the PFA XI . RIO FERDINAND (2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013) Played for: West Ham, Leeds, Manchester United, QPR . A skilful centre half in the continental mould, Ferdinand started at West Ham but was first voted into the Premier League team in 2002 after an excellent season at Leeds United. After impressing at that summer's World Cup, Manchester United paid a \u00a329million transfer fee for Ferdinand, a British record that stood for four years. He became an integral part of Manchester United's success in the 2000s culminating in their Premier League-Champions League double in 2008. Now plays for QPR but is expected to retire at the end of the season . NEMANJA VIDIC (2007, 2008, 2009, 2011) Played for: Manchester United . United's hard-man captain who formed a formidable central defensive partnership with Ferdinand. The Serbia international endured a poor first six months at Old Trafford after arriving from Russian football but went on to become a huge fans' favourite. One of the bravest players seen at Old Trafford, Vidic put his head and body in where others feared to, leading to a number of injuries. When Sir Alex Ferguson left, Vidic signed for Inter Milan, and the incoming manager David Moyes missed his presence. Nemanja Vidic (left) and Rio Ferdinand formed a formidable partnership at the heart of United's defence . ASHLEY COLE (2003, 2004, 2005, 2011) Played for: Arsenal, Chelsea . Considered by many the greatest English left back of all time with more than 100 caps, Cole won the Premier League title with Arsenal and Chelsea with fans in north London not forgiving him for moving to Stamford Bridge. Cole was quick, mobile and had the ability to defend and attack. The controversial decision by Roy Hodgson to leave him out of England's World Cup squad backfired and Cole decided to move abroad where he now plays in Serie A for Roma. One of the few defenders who could get the better of Cristiano Ronaldo in his prime. Ashley Cole (left) gets the better of Cristiano Ronaldo during the 2004-05 season . CRISTIANO RONALDO (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009) Played for: Manchester United . Hard to believe he was only in the Premier League for six years such was the impact he made. He was voted into the PFA team for four seasons in a row before he signed for Real Madrid for a then world-record fee of \u00a380million. There were eyebrows raised when Sir Alex Ferguson sold David Beckham and unveiled an unknown Portuguese teenager. Ronaldo treated Old Trafford to a series of stepovers on his debut and by 2008 was voted World Player of the Year, the only time that honour has gone to someone in the Premier League after Michael Owen in 2001. He has subsequently gone on to scale even greater heights at Real Madrid. Ronaldo was named World Player of the Year during his outstanding Manchester United career . STEVEN GERRARD (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2014) Played for: Liverpool . Indisputably the best player of the Premier League era not to have won the championship, Gerrard is nonetheless regarded as the greatest player in Liverpool's history alongside Kenny Dalglish and was man of the match when he led their comeback in Istanbul to win a fifth European Cup in 2005. Gerrard in his prime was the ultimate box-to-box midfielder, stopping goals, creating goals and scoring goals, often spectacular ones. Will leave Liverpool this summer to join Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS. No player has been named in the PFA XI more times than Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (centre) PATRICK VIEIRA (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004) Played for: Arsenal, Manchester City . Was voted into the PFA team for six consecutive years between 1999 and 2004, an unprecedented spell of dominance in the Premier League era. Vieira was Arsene Wenger's first signing \u2013 actually arriving at Highbury shortly before the manager who was tied up with contractual issues in Japan \u2013 and was the blueprint for an Arsenal team who set new standards for the whole country. A tall, quick and powerful midfielder, Vieira helped Arsenal win the Double and then succeeded Tony Adams as captain, leading the 2004 Invincibles side that went through an entire season unbeaten. Patrrick Vieira (right) gets in the team ahead of his great rival at Manchester United, Roy Keane (left) RYAN GIGGS (1993, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2009) Played for: Manchester United . Statistically the greatest player in the Premier League, with a record number of titles (13) and appearances (632), Giggs was named six times in the PFA team spanning a period of 16 years. He was a flying 19-year-old winger who had led Manchester United to their first championship for 26 years when he was named in the 1993 all-star side, and a clever 35-year-old central midfield playmaker when he was chosen in 2009. Now assistant manager to Louis van Gaal at United having been interim manager at the end of last season. Ryan Giggs back in 1993, when he was entered in his first PFA XI, 16 years before his last . ALAN SHEARER (1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003) Played for: Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle United . The Premier League's record goalscorer with 260 \u2013 more than 70 goals ahead of anyone else, Shearer won the championship with Blackburn Rovers and became the only Premier League player to also be the world's most expensive player when he signed for hometown club Newcastle United for \u00a315million having just finished as leading goalscorer at Euro 96 for England. Shearer could score all types of goals, rocket shots, tap-ins and headers, and following a brief spell as Newcastle's interim manager, is a respected TV pundit. Alan Shearer (left) and strike partner Chris Sutton celebrate after leading Blackburn to the title in 1995 . THIERRY HENRY (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006) Played for: Arsenal . Added Va-Va-Voom to the English game after Arsene Wenger signed him from Juventus and turned an inconsistent winger into the most lethal centre forward in Europe. Like Vieira, Henry was picked for six consecutive PFA teams and won the Golden Boot for being the leading scorer in the division on four occasions. Rivals Cristiano Ronaldo as being the best Premier League import ever seen and after spells with Barcelona and New York Red Bulls is back in this country, offering his views on the game with Sky Sports. Thierry Henry was named in the PFA Xi an incredible six times in a row between 2001 and 2006 . ..and an unlikely all-star XI. These players all made the Premier League team of the season on one occasion: . Tim Flowers; David Bardsley, Ugo Ehiogu, Thomas Vermaelen, Stig Inge Bjornebye; Nani, Scott Parker, Tim Sherwood, Harry Kewell; Emmanuel Adebayor, Chris Sutton .\n",

A New Hampshire ex-official believed to be the first transgender person elected to a state legislature was charged on Thursday with calling in a bomb threat to a hospital, police said. Police arrested 31-year-old Stacie Laughton of Nashua on Thursday following the February 27 threat to Southern New Hampshire Medical Center. Police evacuated the building but found no suspicious device. An investigation led police to issue a warrant for Laughton's arrest; the Nashua resident complied. Calls weren't being accepted Thursday at a phone listed for Laughton. In 2012, Laughton was elected to the state House of Representatives but never took the seat, resigning after reports of a prior felony conviction raised questions about Laughton's legal ability to serve. The state's Ballot Law Commission denied Laughton's request to run again last year, saying Laughton's 2008 convictions for identity fraud and falsifying evidence disqualified the would-be candidate until 2018, when a suspended sentence ends. Laughton was charged on Thursday with making a false report regarding explosives, a felony that can bring up to 7 years in prison if convicted. Laughton was released on $50,000 bond and is due back in court in April. Laughton expressed remorse for alleged actions and blamed them on an untreated mental illness. 'I have had a mental illness my whole life, and I guess this was my worst break with it. I was untreated for a long time, and I didn't have medication,' Laughton told the New Hampshire Union Leader following her arrest. 'I wasn't trying to hurt anyone, and it was totally out of character for me. I have put a lot behind me, and I never thought I would do this in a million years,' she told the newspaper. Stacie Laughton was born Barry C. Laughton Jr. and was convicted twice in Nashua before she ever turned 20. Bomb threat: Police arrested 31-year-old Stacie Laughton of Nashua on Thursday following the February 27 threat to Southern New Hampshire Medical Center (pictured) Police told The Patch that in 2002 she was charged with domestic violence/criminal mischief after an argument with her father during which she smashed a plate. In 2003 she was charged with sexual assault involving a woman from whom she was renting a rorom. 'Those charges were eventually dropped,' Laughton told The Patch in 2012 following her resignation from her elected position. Convicted felon:\u00a0In 2012, Laughton was elected to the state House of Representatives but never took the seat, resigning after reports of a prior felony conviction raised questions about Laughton's legal ability to serve . 'In fact, she still lives in the city, and we see each other from time to time, and we are pleasant. It's as if those years never happened,' she said. Laughton said three years ago that she hopes to run for office again someday despite her sordid past. Her criminal history will prevent her from doing so. 'After I got out of prison I felt like it was a new start for me. I began my transformation, from who I had been for all those years, to who I really was,' Laughton said. 'And ever since that that day, I do something, every day to try to better myself, or help someone else. I am trying to be the best person I can be, and put the past behind me, once and for all. ' wanted change: \u00a0'After I got out of prison I felt like it was a new start for me.

Myanmar's Ministry of Information said in a statement that the ship capsized Friday night as it sailed, in bad weather conditions, around the city of Sittwe. That's when a large wave crashed into the ferry, causing it capsize near Myaybone and Myaukkyine islands. Authorities have managed to rescue at least 167 people, according to the information ministry for Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. Pictures from the government showed rescue workers helping people off a boat onto the land. Sittwe is the capital of Rakhine state and sits on the Bay of Bengal, about 55 miles (90 kilometers) from the Bangladesh border. This weekend's weather forecast for the city calls for some clouds giving way to clear skies, with high daytime temperatures expected to be in the 30s Celsius (80s to 90s Fahrenheit). Fatal ferry disasters are nothing new to the region. Last month, at least 68 people died when a packed double-decker ferry sank while on the Padma River north of neighboring Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, officials said. A cargo vessel hit the ferry, causing it to overturn and trapping passengers on its lower deck. Forty-five people died in an accident on the same river in August. In May 2013, several boats carrying as many as 150 people were thought to have capsized near Myanmar's western coast ahead of a storm approaching the area. Those boats were carrying Rohingya, members of Myanmar's long-suffering Muslim minority, Thailand-based U.N. official Kirsten Mildren said at the time. Journalist Manny Muang reported from Myanmar, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.\n",

Unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show, the BH-03 concept tires combine thermoelectric and piezoelectric materials that generate electricity as the tire rolls. 'This tire generates electricity through the action of materials in the tire that capture and transform the energy created by heat when it flexes as it rolls during normal driving conditions,' Goodyear said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Hot idea: The Goodyear BH-03, unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show, uses two advanced material technologies to capture extra energy from normal wear and tear . Yahoo! reports that the thermoelectric fibers are woven into the tire, converting energy generated through friction caused by the tire's contact with the road. Piezoelectric material would also capture energy generated in the normal physical deformation by strain energy harvesting. It's not clear that the tire could produce the type of energy needed to add significant miles to an electric car's travel radius. A study published in 2012 in Smart Materials and Structures found strain energy harvesting through piezoelectric tire materials was feasible, but the experiment looked to power wireless sensors, not an entire vehicle. The company also unveiled another concept that could take drivers off the beaten path. Showcasing its new Triple Tube tires on the Lexus LF-SA concept car, Goodyear says the tire design has three tubes that can be inflated or deflated to respond to road conditions. High concept: The Lexus LF-SA concept car, also unveiled, showcased Goodyear's Triple Tube tires, which use three inflating and deflating tubes to transform the tire's shape to adapt to road conditions . The tires could change to provide extra grip during high speed driving, increase fuel economy by lowering resistance and even change shape to control against hydroplaning in snow or rain. CNET points out that Goodyear has used Geneva to launch forward-thinking - though not quite market-ready - concepts before, having shown off a tire with two separate rings for different road conditions at last year's auto show. The outer ring of the SUV featured a slick surface with grooves to displace water while driving on a paved road while a smaller inner ring had a inputured surface for traction off road.\n",

        "input": "After being knocked out of the Champions League, Chelsea have just 11 games left this campaign with all eyes geared towards the Premier League title. Although five points clear, some chinks in Jose Mourinho's side's armour were bared for the world to see on Wednesday. Here, Sportsmail lays out five things the Portuguese manager must do to end the season in style. Rediscover the attacking flow . Anyone watching the limp defensive display against Paris Saint-Germain would find it hard to remember, but for the first half of the season, Chelsea were breathtaking. The creative hub of Eden Hazard, Oscar and Cesc Fabregas, the fearsome Diego Costa in full, free-scoring behemoth mode up front, glued together with the tireless Nemanja Matic and a rock-solid back four. Chelsea need to rediscover the attacking form that saw Eden Hazard as the league's best creative force . Diego Costa nets Chelsea's third in a demolition at Swansea that showcased the side's attacking brilliance . Take the departed Andre Schurrle\u2019s goal at Burnley in the season opener, Fabregas\u2019s strike at Crystal Palace, any of the five netted at Swansea\u2026 it seemed the Blues had finally meshed typical Mourinho steel with the beautiful attacking craved by Roman Abramovich. Mar 15 - Southampton (H) Mar 22 - Hull (A) Apr 04 - Stoke (H) Apr 12 - QPR (A) Apr 18 - Manchester United (H) Apr 26 - Arsenal (A) Apr 29 - Leicester City (A) May 02 - Crystal Palace (H) May 16 - West Brom (A) May 24 - Sunderland (H) In recent weeks, however, Mourinho has reverted to defensive type \u2013 to the side\u2019s downfall against 10-man PSG. With a host of winnable games left among the remaining Premier League matches, putting a few teams to the sword in style would do wonders for confidence in the home straight. Use the whole squad . Mourinho has used just 22 players in the league this season \u2013 fewer than any other team. The boss would point to being five points clear at the division\u2019s summit as justification, but the stars of the side being tired out leads to displays like Wednesday\u2019s. Felipe Luis and Loic Remy must have envisaged getting more playing time when moving to Stamford Bridge in the summer, while Juan Cuadrado would hope to have made more of an impact in his two months. The likes of Oscar and Fabregas, in particular, have been noticeably poorer as the season has progressed. Use of the whole squad is key at the top level, and something Mourinho has mastered at all his previous clubs. If he doesn\u2019t trust the players below the first XI, expect changes this summer. While he has less games left than he would have liked, Mourinho must utilise everyone at his disposal to keep the side fresh in the run-in. Loic Remy may be wondering why he has had so little game-time since arriving at Stamford Bridge . Juan Cuadrado has found chances hard to come by since arriving in January from Fiorentina . Give Petr Cech a proper swansong . Thibaut Courtois can be Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper for the next decade. One of the most highly-rated keepers in Europe, his extended loan at Atletico Madrid prepared him for a long career in London. It would follow that we are in the final moments of Petr Cech\u2019s sublime stewardship between the posts. However, the distinction between first and second choice has become far more blurred as the season has progressed. Thibaut Courtois has started to struggle to deal with crosses whipped into the box, leading to goals conceded . Courtois, while one of the world\u2019s finest shot-stoppers, has had trouble claiming crosses and showing authority in the box. Against PSG, he pulled off a terrific stop only to fail to come for the resulting corner. He has time to develop into the role. For now, however, Mourinho must reinstall Cech as undisputed No 1. He has performed in every big game when called upon this season, knows what it takes to win the league, and has the experience required to guide the defence through the last 11 fixtures. Petr Cech has impressed whenever called into the No 1 role after manning the Chelsea gloves for 10 years . Cech (left) knows what it takes to win the title at Chelsea, here celebrating in 2005 with his team-mates . Reclaim the midfield\u2026 by giving Fabregas a rest . When Fabregas left Barcelona in the summer, the Catalan club\u2019s official website bemoaned his performances tailing off in the second half of the season. While this may have been a little facetious, his maiden campaign at Stamford Bridge would appear to prove them correct. The midfielder has been poor since the turn of the year, at least. Cesc Fabregas, battling Marco Verratti, has not been firing on all cylinders since Christmas . Particularly in upcoming fixtures against Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, Mourinho could do with the frenetic presence of Ramires, a repositioned Kurt Zouma or even the young Nathan Ake to add more physical and defensive presence in midfield. Chelsea\u2019s midfield, with the Spaniard at the helm, completely failed to make the extra man count against PSG. Unless Fabregas can prove he is as useful in central midfield against a top side as he is while carving up Swansea or Schalke, he may lose the manager\u2019s faith when it comes to the crunch. Cut out the madness . Every back page in the country on Thursday morning showed Chelsea players surrounding the referee before being dumped out of Europe. It wasn\u2019t the first time Blues fans woke up to see their team being discussed for the wrong reasons this season. Chelsea players surround the referee before Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off during the hot-tempered affair . Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill and Diego Costa have all sparked nationwide debates with on-pitch antics, while Mourinho\u2019s famed siege mentality has manifested itself in fairly ugly ways as the campaign has progressed. In these remaining 11 matches, Chelsea need to do what they do best \u2013 win, with minimum fuss. On form they\u2019re the best team in the country by some distance, so they need to remove the histrionics and resume being plastered over the papers for the right reasons. Diego Costa has been more noticeable for his physical play and histrionics than his goalscoring ability .\n",

It has been revealed by the Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo that the execution of the Bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row. This could delay the pair's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out. Scroll down for video . The Indonesian Governor-General has said the death row inmates will be executed 'simultaneously' Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right, will be put through an 'assimilation' process as they prepare to face the firing squad . This means Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran may have months to wait before they face the firing squad. Mr Prasetyo also claims the death row inmates will be put through an 'assimilation' process which he believes will help them mentally prepare for their death. 'They will be accompanied by religious figures until they're truly ready,' he said. The two men are currently being held in isolation cells where they are able talk to each other. Their interaction with other inmates is limited to one Nigerian who is also on death row. Prison authorities claim there's been no order to move Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran from 'Death Island' even though the appeals process may be lengthy. Although the appeals process may be lengthy there have been no orders to transfer Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan from the prison referred to as 'Death Island' President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores . The pair's lawyers will return to Jakarta court on Thursday to challenge President Widodo's decision to deny clemency to all drug offenders. Their last appeal was adjourned until March 20 as the president's representative did not have the required legal documentation. Two weeks earlier, the Administrative Court dismissed their argument that President Widodo failed to consider their rehabilitation. The pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals . The claim was rejected on the grounds that the court had no authority to overturn presidential decree. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions. Ms Bishop is yet to receive a response. Ms Bishop has offered to cover the costs of life imprisonment for the condemned men, if their lives are spared . The families of the convicted drug offenders have been allowed to visit twice since their transfer to Nusakambangan island last Wednesday, with their next visit scheduled for Monday.

The Kerobokan Jail governor Sudjonggo ordered all 92 prisoner paintings to be removed before the exhibition commenced. A chilling self portrait of Mr Sukumaran that would have been displayed alongside other prisoner art at the Kuta exhibition . He claims that authorities we unaware the event was advertised as a tribute to Mr Sukumaran, a former art teacher at the prison. \u201cIt is cancelled because we do not want to be involved in any matters relating to Myuran. I have conveyed to the organisers about that and they promised that none of Myuran\u2019s paintings will be at the exhibition,\u2019 Sydjonggo said. The exhibition featuring Mr Sukumaran's most recent work was cancelled as prison officials say they didn't want to get caught up in the politicised executions . \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we are forgetting Myuran. No. But we just don\u2019t want to be involved in the discourse about the execution which is now already politicised,\u201d he added. The money raised by auctioning off the prisoners artwork was to be used to continue funding the art program at the Kerobokan prison as well as building a gallery intended to showcase the works of ex-prisoners who were mentored by Mr Sukumaran. Mr Sukumaran has been unable to paint since his transfer to 'Death Island' however prison authorities say Mr Sukumaran will eventually be allowed to have his art materials.

        "input": "Jon Hamm has opened up about his alcohol addiction for the first time. News broke earlier this week that the Mad Men star had just completed a 30 day stint in rehab at the Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut. The 44-year-old said on Wednesday, \u2018Life throws a lot at you sometimes and you have to deal with it as much as you can,\u2019 in an interview with Australian magazine TV Week. After treatment: Jon Hamm completed a 30-day stint in rehab, his rep announced on Tuesday; here he is pictured at LAX airport the same day . When the publication asked him if the life of an actor, where he is often challenged to inhabit dark characters, played a role in his alcoholism he was not entirely dismissive of the notion. 'I've said in varying ways that acting can be a difficult endeavour,' Hamm admitted, 'certainly not as difficult as the recent example I used of being a baby heart surgeon.' \u2018But,' he added, 'it does present its own challenges and so does life.\u2019 Just after he checked out: Hamm attended a special screening of Mad Men on Saturday in New York City with the cast of the hit AMC show; here he is pictured with January Jones . One step at a time: Jon was seen heading home in Los Angeles on Wednesday . Staying busy: The same day, he suited up and flashed a smile while celebrating the final episode of Mad Men with the Black & Red Ball in LA . The question was raised as his character Don Draper on Mad Men is not only plagued by personal demons but is a heavy drinker. But Hamm was quick to note how fortunate he felt to have supportive family and friends by his side as he faces his own personal struggles. A rep for the star told TMZ on Tuesday 'With the support of his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon Hamm recently completed treatment for his struggle with alcohol addiction. 'They have asked for privacy and sensitivity going forward.' The facility:\u00a0The Mad Men actor received treatment at the Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut for alcohol abuse . Inside Silver Hill:\u00a0Though the facility is considered upscale, the rooms are pared down. Some even have two beds as often patients have roommates . She has helped him:\u00a0Hamm's publicist told the site, 'With the support of his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon recently completed treatment for his struggle with alcohol addiction. They have asked for privacy and sensitivity going forward'; here the couple is seen in December . On Tuesday he was spotted at LAX looking well dressed in a white double-breasted coat, black cardigan, grey trousers and black boots. He was also wearing a full beard, sunglasses and a hat. It is not known if Hamm has been in rehab before. His Mad Men character Don Draper was known for heavy drinking. The Silver Hill Hospital is a psychiatric hospital that was established in 1931. The facility provides comprehensive psychiatric and addiction treatment services.\u00a0The campus sits on 42 acres and the buildings have a New England style to them. Though the facility is considered upscale, the rooms are pared down. Some even have two beds as often patients have roommates. His character enjoyed cocktails: Don Draper often drank alcohol; here Hamm is pictured with Mad Men co-star Jessica Par\u00e9 as they both hold up drinks . Raising a glass: The enigmatic advertising executive is famed for his love of booze . Bottom's up: Don celebrates with a glass of the hard stuff in sixties based drama Mad Men . Speaking to\u00a0Esquire in 2014, Jon revealed his sisters once encouraged him to see a therapist following the death of his mother from a brain aneurysm. 'I had no concept of what that even meant,' he said. 'I\u2019m a 20-year-old idiot, in the Midwest. This is not Woody Allen New York. We don\u2019t sit around and talk about our feelings.\u00a0We certainly don\u2019t sit around and compare shrinks.' 'I went to the lady. Sat down and talked to the lady. I gotta say, it helps. Talking to anybody helps. Talking to your friends helps. But your friends are your friends. They\u2019ll tell you what you want to hear. 'The shrink doesn\u2019t sugarcoat it: \"Hey, you\u2019re f***ed up. Do this, this and this. Don\u2019t do this any more.\" It\u2019s a wonderful third-person perspective that you get from an analyst. It\u2019s invaluable, I think.' On the move: The 44-year-old actor was seen dressed in layers as he walked through the airport . Work ahead: Jon had a guest starring role on Tina Fey's Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . He added that his performances as tormented advertising executive Don are based on personal experience. He said: \u00a0'I hope that lends a deeper resonance. It\u2019s not anything I\u2019m doing consciously. All we can do as actors is bring our own personal experience to the role. 'My mother died when I was ten, so I did have far more experience of being raised outside my family than I had from my own home, probably.' The right scruff! The Bridesmaids star is sporting a generous amount of facial hair that evokes a far more rugged image than his Mad Men Don Draper character . In an interview with the Mail On Sunday in 2012, the actor admitted that his parallels with heavy drinker Don stopped at the character's love of \u00a0hard liquor. \u2018I don\u2019t drink as much as Don Draper,\u2019he said. \u2018I would be unconscious if I did.\u2019 He also revealed to suffering from 'clinical depression' following the sudden death of his father when he was 20. 'I very much knew what the idea of permanence was by that point. I dropped out of school, moved into the basement of my older half-sister Julie\u2019s house, enrolled in a local college and sank into depression,' he said. An end:\u00a0Jon's portrayal of the flawed Madison Avenue businessman will end in its seventh season beginning on April 5 as the AMC drama airs its final episodes . \u2018It was the classic definition of clinical depression; you want to stay in bed all day, you sleep till four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I didn\u2019t have any drive to get up and do anything. It was rough: it stinks. 'Other people who are better than me at putting thoughts into words describe it as a black cloud that descends on you. You become numb. You feel so overwhelmed that it\u2019s hard to take any step towards solving your situation.' Jon's portrayal of the flawed Madison Avenue businessman will end in its seventh season, which begins on April 5. He earned a Best Actor Golden Globe Award in 2008 for his role. Ready to promote the show: On Monday the star was seen with his cast again on the Today show in NYC . Since wrapping the series in July, Jon had a guest starring role in Tina Fey's uproarious Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Jon played Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne, a doomsday preacher who lures four women into an underground bunker for years after convincing them of an impending apocalypse - but they are later rescued. The Office alum Ellie Kemper plays the title character opposite Tituss Burgess, Carol Kane and Jane Krakowski. 'I was very glad they asked me to be a part of it,' he revealed to The Daily Beast. 'Ellie Kemper is a really nice person, and I felt honored to be able to play in the sandbox with the cool kids again.' Incredibly, Jon was 34-year-old Ellie's eighth grade teacher in 1993 after he graduated from the University of Missouri with an English degree and taught acting class at the same school he attended years earlier, John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri. Heavy drinker: Jon told the Mail On Sunday in 2012 that he would be 'unconscious' if he consumed as much alcohol as Don . 'I remember walking the red carpet at the Emmys and seeing Ellie there and going, \"You're here, too! This is so great!\"' Speaking to\u00a0GQ in a recent interview, Jon expressed fear about finding work after his run on Mad Men. 'Look, the one constant thing I've had in my career is now removed,' he said. 'And that's an eye-opener: Are people still going to take me seriously? Am I just going to do romantic comedies for the rest of my life? 'What's next? And I don't know, you know? I wish I was smug enough to have had a grand plan.' Different times: Don flourishes in an age where heavy drinking and smoking are encouraged . Finale: The star has been promoting the final season of his hit AMC show .\n",

Earlier on Saturday, Djokovic ended world number four Murray's fine run to a first Masters 1000 semi-final in two years by extending his head-to-head advantage between the pair to 17-8 with a sixth successive win. The Scot elected to receive serve after winning the toss but stumbled as Djokovic quickly reached 4-1 before ruthlessly clinching all three of his break points in the set to prevail. The current Wimbledon champion broke Murray again in the second game of the second set and saved two break points to go to 4-1 and 5-2. Then, after his opponent slipped from 30-0 up to 40-30 down, Djokovic gladly served the match out. Murray said: 'The frustrating thing is obviously getting off to a bad start in both sets.

Djokovic told Sky Sports 3: 'I tried to start with the right intensity, I got a crucial break at the start. 'Andy made a lot of unforced errors, his first-serve percentage was low. I'm sure he knows I'm returning well, I know he's returning well, so that puts added pressure on our serving.'

        "input": "It is one of the most expensive cancer the NHS treats, yet receives only a fraction of cancer research funding. Every year in the UK, 10,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer, and of that half will die from the disease. But experts are today rallying behind a new campaign Shout Out About Bladder Cancer, to raise awareness and vital funds to develop research. It comes as researchers at the University of Birmingham believe a new and simple test could help determine how aggressive a patient's disease is, allowing doctors to tailor individual treatment plans. The scientists, who estimate treating the disease currently costs the NHS \u00a365 million a year, found being able to reliably identify those patients with the most aggressive cancers early after diagnosis 'significantly improved outcomes'. They identified two biomarkers in the urine which they believe can predict a patient's prognosis. A new campaign has been launched to raise public awareness of bladder cancer - the seventh most common cancer in the UK and the form of the disease that costs the NHS most to treat at \u00a365 million a year . Three charities, Action On Bladder Cancer, Fight Bladder Cancer and The Urology Foundation are leading the campaign. It aims to raise funds to invest in bladder cancer research . Dr Douglas Ward, from the University of Birmingham, said: 'There is an urgent need for prognostic biomarkers that could guide patient management. 'If such a test could be delivered, in a non-invasive way, it could make treatment much more efficient and that can only be a good thing.' The Shout Out About Bladder Cancer campaign has been launched by three charities, Action On Bladder Cancer, Fight Bladder Cancer and The Urology Foundation. It aims to raise public awareness of the 'Cinderella disease', in a bid to prevent thousands of 'unnecessary' deaths each year. Louise de Winter, chief executive of The Urology Foundation (TUF), said: 'At TUF we became very aware that bladder cancer is the Cinderella disease which people shy away from talking about. 'We were receiving fewer applications for research into bladder cancer and wanted to make a push to encourage people to do more research into this area. 'By working together with the other charities we believe we can create more awareness of the disease and hopefully provide more funding for research.' 'Progress is being made but we need it to be made faster,' she added. Her colleague in the fight against bladder cancer, Andrew Winterbottom, founder of Fight Bladder Cancer, and a patient of the disease himself, warned that the chances of surviving the disease are 'getting worse'. Smoking is known to be the biggest cause of bladder cancer. The most common symptoms are blood in your wee, frequently needing a wee, recurring urinary infections and abdominal or back pain . There are two main types of bladder cancer. Non-invasive bladder cancer is where the disease develops only in the inner lining of the bladder. Meanwhile invasive bladder cancer is where the cancer has spread into the deeper walls of the bladder. Of more than 200 known cancers, bladder cancer ranks fifth most common in the western world. It is a disease that affects people regardless of age and sex, although it is recognised the chances of developing the disease increase as a person gets older. What causes bladder cancer? Smoking is by far the largest preventable cause of bladder cancer. Other causes include exposure to specific industrial chemicals and dyes, as well as diesel fumes. Studies have also suggested a hereditary link to bladder cancer. However, in almost half of cases experts still do not know what causes the disease. It is one of the reasons the Shout Out About Bladder Cancer campaign team are attempting to raise more money to fund more extensive research. Currently just 0.6 per cent of cancer research is spent on bladder cancer. The result is that treatments for the disease are much the same as they were 35 years ago. A spokesman for the campaign said: 'Quite simply, the current treatments are not very good at preventing recurrence or stopping the cancer spreading and becoming fatal. 'That is why it is still the most expensive cancer for the NHS to treat and it has the highest recurrence rate of any cancer.' The most common symptoms are: . Source: Shout Out About Bladder Cancer . He said: 'People affected by this cancer feel that they are being ignored. 'There have not been any new treatments for more than 30 years. 'Despite being such a common cancer, so few people have ever heard of it, let alone know the causes or symptoms. 'This needs to change which is why one main aim of the campaign is to get as \u00a0many people as possible to start talking about bladder cancer.' Consultant urologist, Hugh Mostafid, chair of Action on Bladder Cancer, added: 'I see every day the huge difference it can make to diagnose bladder cancer early, when its curable. 'Anything that raises public awareness of bladder cancer and therefore makes people seek help earlier is to be welcomed and if we raise money to support research into better treatment at the same time then all the better.' Their quest comes as colleagues at Birmingham University publish their study in the British Journal of Cancer. They hope their findings will prove a vital step forward, paving the way for improved care for every bladder cancer patient. The researchers identified two markers in urine, by analysing specimens provided by volunteers. Two prognostic urinary biomarkers were identified - epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and a protein, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). The scientists concluded therefore that measuring the biomarkers, could 'represent a simple and useful approach for fast-tracking the investigation and treatment of patients with the most aggressive bladder cancers'. They said the tests could prove useful for both newly-diagnosed patients as well as existing patients, who suffer a recurrence of the disease. In addition, by identifying patients with less aggressive forms of the disease, it may allow for fewer visits to specialists, and even discharging patients from specialist care sooner than expected.

It comes as researchers at the University of Birmingham have identified two biomarkers in simple urine tests that could help doctors determine a patient's prognosis, therefore helping to develop tailored treatment plans. The higher the number of biomarkers, the more aggressive a patient's disease, pictured, is . Rik Bryan, from the University of Birmingham, said: 'These biomarkers alone cannot be used to diagnose bladder cancer, but there is immense value in being able to easily and independently indicate the prognosis of the disease in order to guide treatment and decide whether more or less aggressive management is required.' Around 10,000 patients are diagnosed with bladder cancer every year, of which around half will die . Last week the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published new guidelines to ensure bladder cancer patients receive the same level of treatment regardless of where they live. While it is thought to be one of the most expensive cancers to treat for the NHS, there is a wide variation in treatments offered across the country. The guidelines state information given to people diagnosed with the disease should be tailored to every individual's needs. Professor Mark Baker, director of the Centre for Clinical Practice, said: 'Bladder cancer is in the top 10 most common cancers in the UK. 'There are a number of treatments available, but for some people a diagnosis is only made when they are admitted to hospital in an emergency - in these cases the outlook can be poor. 'Bladder cancer can have a profound impact on someone's psychological wellbeing as well as their physical health. 'Both the tumours and the treatments can affect bowel, bladder and sexual function. 'This guideline aims to give people all the information they need about bladder cancer, to help them to make better decisions about their care, and improve their quality of life during and after treatment.'

But we now need to go on and win the Final.\u2019 In the first hafl Northampton had been totally dominant and looked in control of the match, building up a 13-5 half-time lead. However the home side, aided by the wind, launched a rally to run out narrow winners and so deprive Saints of a final appearance on their home ground. Northampton selected a strong pack with Alex Corbisiero, Samu Manoa and Sam Dickinson all included. Mike Haywood was at hooker for his 100th appearance for the Saints whilst flanker Jon Fisher returned after being out with an injury since November. The former England winger touches down in the corner as Saracens reached the LV Cup Final . Saints began strongly and took an early lead. Sam Olver first made a hash of a drop goal attempt but he was on target with a penalty after six minutes. The visitors should have extended that lead but blew a golden opportunity for the first try. A neat break from Kahn Fotuali'i was carried on by Dom Waldouck but when the ball was recycled, Jamie Elliott knocked on with the line in sight. Saints continued to dominate the opening quarter with the home side unable to get out of their own half and they were rewarded when Olver fired over his second penalty with an excellent touchline kick. Eventually Saracens secured some possession to get a platform into the match. Marcelo Bosch made a strong run to put the visitors' defence on the back foot before the centre was again involved when his skilfully timed pass sent Strettle through a large gap through for the opening try of the game. Sam Olver had scored the first try of the game for the Saints but Saracens stormed back to make the final . George Kruis came on for Saracens replacing the injured Hayden Smith before Saints resumed control of the match. Fotuali'i again unlocked the defence to send Olver over for the try, which the outside half converted. When Northampton surprisingly lost a scrum on half-way, Itoje burst away and looked a likely score but he was overhauled by Dickinson, who pulled off a superb cover tackle to keep his side 13-5 ahead at the interval. Within a minute of the restart, Saracens scored a splendid try. Joubert won a line-out and a pre-planned move put Ellery in space for the wing to run elusively past a number of defenders for the try which Spencer converted before the scrum half added a penalty to put the hosts in front for the first time. Ernst Joubert gets up highest to secure line-out ball in an excellent second-half display from the home side . Assisted by the wind, Saracens were a totally different proposition in the third quarter as it was now Saints' turn to be hemmed in their own half and they fell further behind when Spencer knocked over two further penalties. After 60 minutes, Saints introduced Myler and Dickson at half-back in an attempt to revive their fortunes and it soon paid dividends with Dickson nipped over on the blindside following a driving line-out with Myler converting with a brilliant touchline kick. Northampton threatened a comeback but a late drop goal from Nils Mordt saw Saracens to the final, where they will play either Leicester or Exeter, who play tomorrow. Ben Ramsen is dragged down by Northampton's Ben Nutley as Saracens avenged last year's losses .\n",
        "output": "Northampton had led 13-5 had half time but Saracens fight back . Saracens wing David Strettle scores excellent try in win . Saints won at same stage last year, but Sarries treble hopes stay alive . Saracens will now play Leicester or Exeter in LV Cup Final .\n"

        "input": "(CNN)A court in Turkey this week sentenced two cartoonists to 11 months and 20 days in prison for insulting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Soon after, the court changed the jail sentence to a fine of 7,000 Turkish lira or about $2,700 each. Cartoonists Bahadir Baruter and Ozer Aydogan draw for the weekly satirical magazine Penguen. Founded in 2002 with a weekly average of 65,000 readers, the irreverent comic book -- similar in many ways to the French magazine Charlie Hebdo -- regularly skewers Turkish politicians. A defamation suit was filed against an August cover of Penguen in which a cartoon figure of Erdogan is welcomed to the presidential palace by a public servant. Erdogan tells him, \"But this is so dry. We could have at least slaughtered a journalist.\" In a statement to the press, the Penguen team explained that a citizen who described himself as an Erdogan supporter \"sent an email to the Prime Ministry Information Center. ... According to the notice, the employee (in the cartoon) 'made the gay signal with his fingers.' \" Turkey's public prosecutor eventually launched an investigation, claiming that both the speech bubbles and the \"hand drawing\" insulted Erdogan. While the court ruled Wednesday in favor of Erdogan, a full-length explanation of the verdict will be released in a week to 10 days. It is so far unclear whether the judge ruled that the speech bubbles or the \"gay hand gesture\" or both were an insult. The ruling comes amid an increase in criminal cases lodged against journalists, students and public figures for \"defamation against a public officer.\" In 2014, Turkey was ranked one of the world's worst jailers of journalists by the media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders and its press status \"not free\" by Freedom House. The Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Nils Mui\u017enieks, expressed his concern about the ruling against Penguen as well as the surge in criminal cases against people accused of insulting Erdogan. \"This sentence is misguided and, along with a pattern of criminal prosecutions, sends a chilling message to media professionals and all those who want to exercise their right to free expression,\" Mui\u017enieks said. Ann Harrison of freedom of press advocacy group PEN International told CNN, \"We have long called for decriminalization of defamation, particularly of state officials, as to criminalize criticism of authorities severely stifles reporting and public debate.\" Harrison noted that special mandates from the United Nations, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Organization of American States have called for the abolishment of criminal defamation laws. Penguen announced it will appeal the decision. The magazine also defiantly released a new cartoon mocking the case. \"We will continue drawing our cartoons,\" Penguen announced in a statement. \"We hope this case will be the last example of the intimidation effort on free thought.\"\n",

        "input": "Hong Kong (CNN)\"Go back home!\" \"Locusts! You're not welcome here!\" These were just some of the insults hurled at Chinese shoppers Sunday as hundreds of Hong Kongers surged through through the old neighborhood of Yuen Long, an area close to the city's border with China. It was the latest in a series of angry protests that have seen brawls erupt in humdrum shopping malls, with demonstrators singling out the \"parallel traders\" who crowd into Hong Kong to purchase tax-free products and then resell them for a profit back in China. \"I've grown up here, and ever since a lot of the Chinese started coming into Hong Kong, things have changed,\" said Suen, a law student who only gave her surname. Clad in a mask to protect against police wielding pepper spray, she took part in the protest with her mother. Local residents say the traders are not only disturbing the peace, but are driving up the price of food, rent, and gutting local neighborhoods of their character - the city has become a blur of jewelers, pharmacies and other businesses that cater primarily to Chinese shoppers. \"Previously there were a lot of indigenous places like restaurants, but all of them have closed,\" said Suen, standing across from a store selling baby milk powder - the top item on many Chinese tourists' shopping lists. \"It's very difficult to be very welcoming.\" Tensions have long been simmering between Hong Kong and the motherland, and parallel trading is just one of the thorny issues brought about by the influx of mainland Chinese to the city. A series of food scandals -- most notably in 2008 when melamine-tainted milk powder caused infant deaths across China -- led to shortages of baby milk formula in Hong Kong as Chinese flocked to buy up the city's supplies. The ensuing uproar led the government to introduce a law limiting the purchase to two tins per traveler leaving the city. Last year, 31 million Chinese visitors traveled to Hong Kong, accounting for 78% of all tourists, according to the government. But the numbers hide that the visitors aren't all sightseeing tourists in the traditional sense. There are the day-trippers, wheeling suitcases and carting boxes of goods and supplies across the border, but there is also an increasing number of wealthy mainland Chinese who are buying up luxury properties, and visit the city on a regular basis. According to the Global Property Guide, developers say as much as 40% of new home buyers are from China. Residents blame them for causing a hike in real estate prices in what reports say is already the most expensive property market in the world. Both the Chinese and Hong Kong government have encouraged mainland tourists to visit the city and boost the local economy. Relaxed restrictions have made it easy for Chinese residents to get a hold of individual multiple-entry permits -- some mainlanders enter hundreds of times a year on a single pass. This has infuriated protestors, particularly the younger generation, who want the government to scrap the permits. In a speech last Tuesday, the city's pro-Beijing leader C.Y. Leung announced that his government would examine restricting mainland visitors, acknowledging the pressure the crowds have had on the everyday lives of Hong Kong residents. But the permit controversy is just one symptom of a deeper conflict. When it comes down to it, it's simple: Many Hong Kongers just don't feel very Chinese. According to a recent survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the number of Hong Kong residents identifying primarily as \"Chinese\" has dipped to an all-time low since the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997. The majority of respondents said they were \"Hong Kongers first, and also Chinese.\" Earlier in 2012, plans to add Chinese civic education into the Hong Kong public school curriculum caused an uproar, resulting in a city-wide protest with locals claiming it would \"brainwash\" school children with pro-mainland propaganda. Hong Kong, ruled under China's principle of \"One country, two systems,\" means the city is a officially part of China, but is allowed rights and freedoms unseen in other Chinese cities. But there's one key privilege Beijing has refused to grant to Hong Kong: Free and open elections for their own leader. Frustrated Hong Kongers have tried everything to demand greater voting rights, from hunger strikes to massive street occupations, with no luck. That's why people in Hong Kong feel an increasing sense of resentment and helplessness when it comes to solving the complex, growing rift between their city and mainland China. A small but growing minority of disgruntled activists go as far as to say Hong Kong should not belong to China at all. \"We Hong Kong people have our own culture, we have our own currency, we have all the requirements to build a country.\" said Julian Li, a member of a radical pro-Hong Kong group. \"For decades we have been fighting against civic rights, democracy. However, no matter how much we have been working, it's like we're begging for something that will never happen.\" Many mainland Chinese are bewildered by the anger directed at them. \"It's normal for people to spend money and shop here, why are they protesting?\" said a Chinese tourist waiting at a bus stop to get away from the angry crowds. She said her suitcase was loaded with make-up and clothing that is much cheaper to buy in Hong Kong than across the border in her hometown of Zhuhai. \"There's definitely an element of discrimination against mainlanders here. I'm not saying everyone is like that in Hong Kong, but there are certain people who are very prejudiced,\" she added. Another Chinese resident who makes weekly visits to relatives in the city was sitting on a curb away from the ruckus. She said her friends have considered boycotting Hong Kong altogether. \"My friends on WeChat say, don't come to Hong Kong, let's burn our travel permits,\" she said as she thumbed through the receipts of her latest purchases. \"We should all just be more considerate and tolerant of each other, we're just here to shop. Let's just be happy,\" she said.\n",

        "input": "Cats can sometimes be a mystery, even to their owners. But our felines friends may not be as difficult to understand as you might think, with clues to their personality hidden in their features. This is according to a California-based cat behaviourist who has identified three different types of cat face shape that she says can accurately reveal personality. Scroll down for video . 'Cats with square faces are often keen to please their owners. 'Square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts,' said cat behaviourist, Arden Moore . 'Cat face geometry is one of the best tools for matching a cat to a person,' says Arden Moore, author of 'Fit Cat: Tips & Tricks to Give Your Pet a Longer, Healthier, Happier Life'. 'It especially helps with \"mutt\" cats whose breed cannot be determined.' While Moore's theory is not based on any scientific study, she says experience has revealed there is a strong link between looks and personality. This may be because different breeds of cats, with distinct behaviours, often have the same face shape. For instance, some cats, such as Main Coon, can have square faces and bodies.\u00a0These cats are often keen to please their owners. 'Square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts,' said Moore. Triangular cats have been referred to as 'the herding dogs of the cat world.' Triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy, curious, smart and vocal . Cats with round faces have flatter features, large eyes, circular heads and rounded bodies. \u00a0Arden Moore describes them as the 'lap dogs' of the feline world.'They tend to be low-energy, easily frightened, submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members,' she said . According to a report in the New York Post, the best type of owner for these cats is one that has a a social life, works a 9-to-5 job and has a family who will play with the pet. Cats with round faces. meanwhile, also have flatter features, large eyes, circular heads, and rounded bodies, such as a Persian cat. Moore describes them as the\u00a0'lap dogs' of the feline world, and 'library cats'. Square - 'The retrievers' These cats are often large with square faces and bodies. Maine Coon, the largest domesticated breed of cat, falls into this category. They have been described as the 'retrievers of the cat world.' Cats with square faces are often keen to please their owners. 'Square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts,' said cat behaviourist, Arden Moore. Ideal owner: Works a 9-to-5 job and has a family who will play with the pet. Round - 'The lapdogs' Cats with round faces also have flatter features, large eyes, circular heads, and rounded bodies. An example would be the Persian cat.\u00a0Arden Moore describes them as the\u00a0'lap dogs' of the feline world. 'They tend to be low-energy, easily frightened, submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members,' she said. Ideal owner: A homebody who enjoys spending time with the cat in a quiet environment. Triangular - 'The herders' Cats with triangular faces include Siamese or Abyssinian cats. They are sleek and lanky cats, often boasting big ears and faces that narrow at the nose. They have been referred to as 'the herding dogs of the cat world.' \u00a0Triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy, curious, smart and vocal. Ideal owner:\u00a0Someone who wants to show off their pet and teach it tricks, and who doesn't own, another submissive cat. 'They tend to be low-energy, easily frightened, submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members,' Moore told Petsbest.com.

The eighth grader, whose name has not been released, admitted to savagely beating Blake Kitchen, 12, in their school's lunchroom. He was was told by the judge to get his anger under control and to change his behavior during a hearing on Thursday at Clay Count family court. The teen will be assessed by Missouri youth workers to determine what kind of treatment he will receive while in the custody of the state-run agency, which is for youths placed by juvenile courts, according to the Kansas City Star. Scroll down for video . The 14-year-old student who severely beat a Missouri sixth-grader with Asperger's syndrome will be taken into custody by the state's youth services division for treatment.\u00a0The teen, whose name has not been released, admitted to striking Blake Kitchen (above), 12, in their school's lunchroom last month . In the February 19 attack, Blake (above) was knocked unconscious and suffered from a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School . 'They can pretty much tailor a program to each individual kid based on their needs,' said Janet Rogers, interim juvenile officer for Clay County. 'Their goal is to get these kids turned around so they can make better choices before they hit adulthood.' In the February 19 attack, Blake was knocked unconscious and suffered from\u00a0a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School. Blake has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. His parents said that turned troublesome when last month, a boy moved Blake's belongings from his seat. When Blake asked the boy to move, another boy began hitting him. 'Then I blacked out,' Blake told WDAF. 'My ear hurts, my jaw hurts, my back hurts and that's all.' Blake (pictured left and right) has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. The altercation occurred after some other schoolchildren moved his stuff in the cafeteria one morning . Blake's mother, Destiny, said the boy continued to beat her son even after he had blacked out, but she said luckily he does not remember the attack, according to Fox2Now. 'He doesn't remember any of that. I guess that was a blessing. He was unconscious and doesn't remember being violently attacked. It's sad he didn't stop,' she said. 'Anytime they moved him he would vomit. Dry heaving constantly, just dry heaving. Him crying and saying it was so painful and he was afraid he was going to die. He was like 'I don't want to die'.' Blake spent five days at Children's Mercy Hospital and was later released. His injuries have left him facing a second surgery and he is still unable to return to school but is trying to keep up online. Prior to the incident, Blake's parents sent a certified letter to the school's principal complaining about the same boy bullying Blake's older brother. Programs have been put in place following the incident to address bullies and other serious issues, Liberty superintendent Jeremy Tucker (above) announced on Thursday . The Liberty School District is still evaluating the attack and bullying present in its schools (above Liberty Middle School) 'It could have been avoided,' said Destiny. She said that she hopes the teen gets the help that he needs so that he does not harm anyone else. The eighth grader was arrested and referred to juvenile court following the incident, said Liberty police Capt. Andy Hedrick. At the time of the hearing on Thursday, he was still in juvenile custody. During the proceeding, the teen's lawyer, Gregory Culotta, said the boy and his family are very sorry for what happened, according to\u00a0KMBC. He also mentioned that his client suffered at the hands of some bullying himself for nearly a year at school and on the bus. Culotta also disputed that there was ongoing bullying evident with the boy against Blake and his siblings.

        "input": "A KIM JONG-IL PRODUCTION . by Paul Fischer . (Penguin/Viking \u00a314.99) Were it not for the fact that North Korea is despicably tragic, it would be comical in the extreme. As a nation, it is so hermetically sealed \u2014 the regime lets \u2018few foreigners in and virtually no information out\u2019 \u2014 that the population has never heard of Jesus, Santa or Elvis. They fully believe their Dear Leader, Kim Jong-Il, who died in 2011, was descended from an egg impregnated by the sun and that when he went into battle, he rode on a unicorn. At the grand age of eight weeks, Kim was walking, talking and dispensing sage military advice. He could control the weather and catch rainbows with his bare hands. The North Koreans believe that\u00a0their Dear Leader, Kim Jong-Il, who died in 2011, was descended from an egg impregnated by the sun . Such was (and is) the potency of North Korea\u2019s messianic cult, however, that dare to laugh at such claims and a prison camp \u2014 or \u2018custody management centre\u2019 or \u2018enlightenment centre\u2019 \u2014 awaits. Paul Fischer, in this gripping tale, tells us that a typical penal colony near Pyongyang, the capital city, is bigger than the entire surface area of Los Angeles, with 220,000 inmates. Criminals include painters or poets whose work is \u2018too Western\u2019. The Ministry for the Protection of State Security rounds up people who have used more than the allocated quota of electricity, or have been accused of wearing blue jeans, growing their hair too long, reading a foreign newspaper or cracking jokes about Kim\u2019s appearance (Kim Jong-Il\u2019s son, the latest dictator, Kim Jong-Un, is another squat little monster, \u2018prone to bursts of anger and bad temper\u2019). There are no trials \u2014 simply the whim of the current Kim. One person\u2019s guilt implicates an entire family. \u2018Children are executed in front of their mothers, wives in front of their husbands.\u2019 Children who informed on their parents were commended for their patriotism. Husbands suspected of a political crime would beg to be able to shoot their own wives as a sign of loyalty. In this evil hell-hole in Kim Jong-Il\u2019s time, \u2018chatter, laughter and singing were forbidden\u2019. If Kim Jong-Il himself had one weakness, however, it was for the movies. Though he had personal control over huge armies and a nuclear arsenal, Kim\u2019s mind was filled less with totalitarian ideology than with \u2018James Bond and Rambo . . . His favourite stars were Sean Connery and Elizabeth Taylor\u2019. It must be a mightily strange person who can confuse Elizabeth Taylor with Sylvester Stallone. Nevertheless, Kim set up the Central Film Distribution Centre, which obtained prints from abroad and secretly dubbed them into Korean using professional actors. Fischer says Kramer Vs. Kramer and Mary Poppins were in the Pyongyang vaults \u2014 though only Kim was permitted to screen such incendiary foreign fare. It was Kim\u2019s dream to establish \u2018a world-class film industry\u2019 but, unfortunately, local productions were boring in the extreme \u2014 \u2018tedious stories of selfless factory workers and exemplary farm girls\u2019. The North Korean leader (left) had a weakness for films despite the strict regulations he imposed on his country, he wished to establish a 'world-class film industry' The studios had access only to a limited stock of \u2018ill-fitting uniforms, wigs and detachable facial hair\u2019. The sets consisted of a Tyrolean chalet and a fake vineyard. Not only that, but actors and actresses often disappeared mid-scene. If they were \u2018declared guilty of some obscure offence\u2019, their performances would literally be chopped from the celluloid, \u2018rendering the film unintelligible\u2019 when shown. Nor was kissing or a love scene ever depicted \u2014 emotion had to be reserved for the Dear Leader. It was a rule that North Korea was always to be shown in rich sunshine. Scenes set abroad had to be uninvitingly dark and rain-swept. In the wider world, Spielberg, Scorsese and George Lucas were emerging so, in 1978, Kim had the idea to abduct a director and star from South Korea, whose \u2018knowledge and manpower\u2019 would stimulate his own cinematic ambitions. Shin Sang-Ok and his wife, Choi Eun-Hee, who\u2019d produced \u2018melodramas, thrillers, historical epics and martial arts films full of frantic zooms and moving cameras\u2019, were snatched from Hong Kong harbour, drugged and bundled into a speedboat by the North Korean \u2018covert operations department.\u2019 They were kept apart and for five years were held in solitary confinement or put under strict house arrest. Kim Jong-Il abducted a South Korean filmmaker\u00a0Shin Sang-Ok and his wife, Choi Eun-Hee in 9178 in a bid to bring a thriving film industry to North Korea . Choi was made to memorise passages from hagiographies of Kim Jong-Il and his equally demented father Kim Il-Sung. \u2018You must bear some pain for the good of the revolution,\u2019 she was told. At gunpoint, she underwent \u2018daily compulsory ideology training sessions\u2019. No debate or voicing of doubt was allowed. Shin, having made a feeble attempt to escape, was flung into a prison cell, where he had to sit immobile in the same cross-legged position, staring straight ahead, for 16 hours a day. If he swayed or blinked, he had to thrust his hands through the bars, so that his fingers could be \u2018smashed violently with the guard\u2019s baton\u2019. But Shin was lucky. Other prisoners had their fingers and ears melted away by the sheer intensity and duration of electric shocks. No prisoner could sit or lie down, in any event, because the cramped cells were covered with spikes. Sanitation was non-existent. Eventually, in 1983, when it was believed that Shin and Choi had been thoroughly indoctrinated, they were introduced to Kim in person \u2014 all 5 ft 2 in of him, in platform shoes and bouffant hair. The Dear Leader invited his \u2018guests\u2019 to attend regular feasts and drunken orgies thrown for elite members of the Workers\u2019 Party Central Committee and the Propaganda and Agitation Department. Though the remainder of the country was starving and poverty stricken \u2014 subsisting on frogs and mice \u2014 Kim indulged himself with imported exotic foodstuffs. Kim Jong-Il (left) is seen her with his son, Kim Jong-Un (right) who is now the North Korean leader since his father's death . He collected motorcycles and Mercedes limousines, built luxurious villas, travelled on private trains and drank expensive Cognac \u2014 the annual budget for Hennessy VSOP was $700,000. He paid for all of this with the loans given to the country by Moscow and Beijing, the proceeds of organised crime and bogus insurance claims made against Allianz Global and Lloyd\u2019s of London. Yet if ever a whisper of this excess or embezzlement got out, executions followed. Assuring Kim that \u2018I will take part in the revolution\u2019, Shin agreed to make a propaganda film. Here, he believed, was a way of escape. He encouraged Kim to permit a location shoot abroad in Budapest and Vienna. They had built up sufficient trust to be allowed to travel. Though surrounded by armed guards, Shin and Choi made a dash for it in Austria and hid in the American Embassy. They were flown to Virginia. In time, Shin made Ninja films for the Disney Channel and was a juror at Cannes with Clint Eastwood. He died of liver disease in 2006. Choi moved back to Seoul, South Korea, where she continues to live in obscurity, her history disbelieved by her neighbours who regard her as a defector, not a former abductee. It does all sound almost too far-fetched and, well, cinematic to be true, but Fischer assures us he has checked and double-checked the available facts. The book is a nightmarish, clammy adventure story, an absolutely brilliant page-turner.\n",

Welcome to Nigeria's free readers associations -- where mostly young men gather around newspaper vendors to read the headlines and debate the issues of the day. They are called \"free\" because nobody actually buys the newspapers they are reading. Discussions among the free readers are loud and furious and have only intensified as Nigeria goes to the polls to decide who will be the next president. Newspaper vendor John Mgbachi, a former shoemaker from Eastern Nigeria, who has a stand in Tinubu Square on Lagos Island said that far from being bad for business, he welcomes the free readers. \"They are passionate about the news and and their presence is an advert for me,\" he said. Mgbachi told CNN that he often sees a big rise in numbers around football tournaments, mostly the Premier League, and also during the election campaign period. To avoid losing out on sales too much, Mgbachi has developed an interesting business model: \"I decided not to make (reading) completely free. For some of the dailies, its 20 naira,(10 cents) 30 naira (15 cents) for the sports papers and 50 naira (30 cents) for the magazines. \"It's not really a static price, it depends on the bargaining power of the person,\" he added. Some even take out a monthly subscription to read the newspapers. The free readers come from all walks of life and CNN spoke to analysts, an accountant and unemployed youth at the stand we visited. They talked about the excitement of discussing the current affairs with others while reading the daily newspaper. One told us he had made two very good friends and even landed a job offer. Mgbachi added there has a been a sharp decline in readers because most people now read their news on the internet. He added that the dire economic situation in the country meant that many Nigerians cannot afford to buy newspapers. Most of Nigeria's $70 billion oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a politically connected elite while many of its citizens struggle to make ends meet.\n",

        "input": "His lack of goalscoring early on in his Barcelona career might have drawn some critics, but Luis Suarez is the best signing of the season in terms of chance creation - ahead even of Barclays Premier League assists king Cesc Fabregas. CIES Football Observatory have compiled the top 12 signings of the season in the top five European leagues for rigour, take-ons, recovery, chance creation, distribution and shooting - using statistics to analyse and narrow them down. And \u00a375million summer buy Suarez comes out on top in the 'chance creation' category ahead of two of the Premier League's finest, Fabregas and Swansea City's Gylfi Sigurdsson. Luis Suarez has been the best signing in terms of chance creation this season, say CIES Football Observatory . Cesc Fabregas is in second place on the 'chance creation' indicator despite his 15 league this season . Here are how the CIES Football Observatory Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) work: . Chance creation: ability to put team-mates in a good position to score. Shooting: ability to take advantage of goal opportunities through accurate shooting. Take on: ability to create dangerous situations by successfully challenging opponents. Distribution: ability to keep a hold on the game through efficient passing. Recovery: ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through proficient interception work. Rigour: ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through robust duelling. Suarez seems to finally be finding his feet at the Nou Camp, and he scored twice in the 2-1 win at Manchester City in the first leg of Barca's Champions League last-16 tie - but it's his work in support of team-mates which has really impressed his manager and supporters since his summer arrival. He has scored\u00a0just 10 times in all competitions in 24 games, but there is no crisis because of a love for the new Suarez \u2013 the one who makes their all-star front three of him, Lionel Messi and Neymar tick. That new-found selflessness puts him ahead of Fabregas in terms of chance creation - despite the Chelsea star's 15 assists in the Premier League this season. That has obviously come at a sacrifice though, and Suarez hasn't been able to get close to the No 1 signing in the shooting category: Chelsea's Diego Costa. 1. Luis Suarez . 2. Cesc Fabregas . 3. Gylfi Sigurdsson . 4. James Rodriguez . 5. Toni Kroos . Barcelona . Chelsea . Swansea . Real Madrid . Real Madrid . 1. Diego Costa . 2. Antoine Griezmann . 3. Khouma Babacar . 4. Luciano Vietto . 5. Felipe Caicedo . Chelsea . Atletico Madrid . Fiorentina . Villarreal . Eibar . Suarez has moved from a goalscorer role to that of a provider since moving to Barcelona in the summer . Diego Costa (left) and Fabregas (right) have formed a deadly combination for Chelsea since signing . Costa is tops the rankings for 'shooting' as shown here by his fierce effort leading to a goal against Tottenham . An impressive 17 league goals put Costa top ahead of Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann . Top scorer in the Premier League with 17 league goals, and having played a key part in the Blues' Capital One Cup triumph against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, nobody would contest that \u00a332m Costa has settled perfectly into the Stamford Bridge set-up. Behind him is Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann who looked to have been signed primarily as the creative force to feed another signing, Mario Mandzukic, but instead has been showing his own goalscoring prowess in a more advanced role. Some more surprising names in that list come from Fiorentina, Villarreal and Eibar in the form of Khouma Babacar, Luciano Vietto and Felipe Caicedo respectively - with West Ham's bargain buy Diafra Sakho coming in just outside the top five in seventh. Alexis Sanchez, despite his recent drought, is 12th. 1. Karim Bellarabi . 2. Angel di Maria . 3. Alexis Sanchez . 4. Diego Perotti . 5. Sadio Mane . Bayer Leverkusen . Manchester United . Arsenal . Genoa . Southampton . 1. Xabi Alonso . 2. Cesc Fabregas . 3. Toni Kroos . 4. Gary Medel . 5. Ivan Rakitic . Bayern Munich . Chelsea . Real Madrid . Inter Milan . Barcelona . Karim Bellarabi (left) is top for 'take on' as he showed by going past Atletico's Guilherme Siqueira last week . Angel di Maria (left) has struggled to keep up his standards at Manchester United but does well for 'take ons' Xabi Alonso might have been surplus to requirements at Real Madrid but his distribution is valued at Bayern . Fabregas' passing ability has helped to bring Chelsea to the level of potential league champions this season . Another surprise name doing well in the distribution group is former Cardiff City flop Gary Medel (left) Jose Mourinho's summer business has been widely lauded and it is perhaps telling that Fabregas is also second in the 'distribution' indicator, with none of Chelsea's former players who moved on making it into the top 12 of any of the categories. Fabregas is only ousted in the list focused on efficient passing by Bayern Munich's Xabi Alonso, who is top ahead of his replacement at Real Madrid, Toni Kroos, in third. Inter Milan's Gary Medel, who signed from relegation Cardiff City in the summer is fourth with Ivan Rakitic fifth. Players from the Premier League dominate the 'take on' group, with Angel di Maria (second), Sanchez (third) and Sadio Mane (fifth) - although all fall in the wake of Bayer Leverkusen trickster, and reported Manchester United target, Karim Bellarabi. 1. Walter Gargano . 2. Wendell . 3. Dusan Basta . 4. Jin-su Kim . 5. Davide Astori . Napoli . Bayer Leverkusen . Lazio . Hoffenheim . Roma . 1. Dejan Lovren . 2. Davide Astori . 3. Michael Keane . 4. Sergi Gomez . 5. Ermin Bicakcic . Liverpool . Roma . Burnley . Celta Vigo . Hoffenheim . Walter Gargano (right) looks to have been a top signing for Napoli if you trust his recovery stats . Dejan Lovren (left) surprisingly tops the 'rigour' category despite a difficult first season with Liverpool . Burnley's Michael Keane (left) is another surprise name on that list after moving from Manchester United . While there are some surprise names on the lists, perhaps the biggest is Liverpool's \u00a320m centre back Dejan Lovren, who somehow finishes top of the 'rigour' category for 'ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through robust duelling'. Lovren, widely regarded as a transfer flop, finishes ahead of Roma's Davide Astori - who also scored highly in the 'recovery' category - and Burnley's Michael Keane. And Rafael Benitez seems to have done good business in signing Walter Gargano for Napoli. He tops the 'recovery' category with only one English-based player in the top 12, Manchester United's Daley Blind - in 12th place. Manchester United's Daley Blind is the only top 12 player in terms of 'recovery' from the Premier League .\n",

During a 12-year long search to find his real parents, Aaron Levi, 50, received confirmation from his birth mother that the Hall of Fame basketball player is his father. After he found his biological mother 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, the white British woman told him she conceived him after a one-night stand with Chamberlain, he told\u00a0Sports Illustrated. Documents with background information about Levi's biological parents noted that Elizabeth would not identify the father to protect his name, and that she gave Levi up for adoption because she felt she could not raise a bi-racial child. Scroll down for video . During a 12-year long search to find his birth parents, Aaron Levi (left), 50, received confirmation from his birth mother that the Hall of Fame basketball player, Wilt Chamberlain, is his father. But Chamberlain, who died in 1999, claimed that he would never have a child . The 7'1' star, who once scored 100 points in one game, boasted about having slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above.\u00a0He worked out he slept with, on average, 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old . Even though the 7'1' star claimed he slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above, he maintained until he died in 1999 that he did not have any children. Chamberlain, who once scored 100 points in one game, worked out he slept with on average 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old. Levi, who stands at 6'5' tall, said that had he known the San Francisco Warrior player was his father 20 years ago, when Chamberlain was still alive, his life would have been completely different. Born in 1965, Levi was raised in Oregon by adoptive parents Don and Harriet, and only knew very few details about his birth parents growing up. 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, said she met Chamberlain at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out with him a few nights later. She said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment, and that night Levi was conceived . He began the search for them in 2003 and got closer to answers after collecting background information in 2004. The information, which is believed to be provided entirely by Elizabeth, said that Levi's mother was a white woman of English-French descent; while details of his father included that he was was a black professional basketball player who was 6'10', born in Kansas and held a Masters degree. However, the details did not exactly match with those of Chamberlain: the NBA star was from Philadelphia and attended the University of Kansas for only three years without obtaining a degree. As he continued to search for more answers, in 2009, Levi received a birth certificate with Elizabeth's name and was eventually connected with her. He said: 'It's been a burden on me to feel that I am her secret, and I am Wilt's secret, and I am the Chamberlain family's secret. 'That's been hard for me...I already know what's going to happen if I don't do anything. I'm going to have an unfinished journey.' After a more than hour-long conversation, she revealed the details of her 'casual relationship' with Chamberlain. Elizabeth said they met at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out a few nights later, when she said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment. When Chamberlain learned of the news that Elizabeth was pregnant, he chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?' That night, she conceived Levi and five months later told him she was pregnant and had plans to give the child up for adoption. When Chamberlain learned of the news, he chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?' Levi has tried to reach out to some of Chamberlain's relatives who remain closed to meeting him and refuse to participate in DNA tests because they feel doubts surround his claim. In his continued mission of self-discovery, he hopes to inspire other people who have been adopted to begin their searches earlier than he did. Levi and Elizabeth met in person in 2010, where they had different feelings about Chamberlin, and spent time together again in England last Fall. He said: 'I wanted her to tell me something good about him, but that wasn't going to happen. I realized that we had different feelings about him. 'She sees him as a womanizer...to me, he's my father.'\n",

And Mancini has cheekily hinted that Toure would fancy a move to Italy after a difficult season with City chasing Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race. Yaya Toure (left) is wanted by Roberto Mancini (right) at Inter Milan after their time at Manchester City .

Mancini is back as Inter Milan manager and wants to bring high-profile players to Italy's Serie A . Toure has two years left on his City contract, and there seems no chance that the Premier League champions would be interested in selling a star player and part of the spine of Manuel Pellegrini's team. And Pellegrini has spoken out previously to confirm that Toure will not be leaving - not that it's stopping Mancini. Last month Pellegrini said: 'I don\u2019t have an opinion about what another manager says about Yaya. 'Of course, every manager of every team would want Yaya in their team but I don\u2019t have anything to say about that.' Toure rues a missed chance for City - and he has struggled to match their usual standards at times this year . Manuel Pellegrini says Mancini can forget about signing Toure but the Italian won't seem to back down . And Mancini certainly seems interested in his former players, having also tried to sign City youth product from Fiorentina, where he is on loan, in January. 'We did try to get him, as he was my player at City,' Mancini told Gazzetta TV. 'Fiorentina seemed open to it, but the move didn\u2019t go through.'

The 67-year-old inventor and entrepreneur has invested $15 million (\u00a310 million) in Michigan-based battery experts Sakti3. The company has developed a range of 'solid-state' batteries (SSBs) that store 50 per cent more energy than current models and will make our favourite gadgets smaller and safer. Scroll down for video . Dyson inventor Sir James Dyson has invested $15 million (\u00a310 million) in Michigan-based Sakti3. The firm has developed a solid-state battery capable of storing double the amount of power as traditional lithium-ion models. The batteries could feature in Dyson's cordless cleaners as well as phones and other gadgets . It is the first investment Sir James has made outside of his bagless vacuum business. Batteries have three main components - the anode, cathode and electrolyte. This electrolyte is typically a chemical that separates the anode and cathode and moves the flow of electrical charge between the two. The majority of batteries found in phones, electric cars and Sir James' range of cordless vacuums use lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology. Lithium-ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte and because lithium is a highly-reactive element it stores a large amount of energy. But this liquid electrolyte is often flammable and has been blamed for batteries bursting into flames when overheated, for example. Due to the safety implications of placing flammable liquids in electric cars, too, many of these auto-based batteries have added safety features making them expensive to run. Lithium-ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte but this liquid electrolyte is flammable. Sakti3's SSBs are based on the same Li-ion technology but replace the liquid electrolyte with a coating of non-flammable metal. This makes them safer, smaller, (pictured) more robust and mean they can be used at higher temperatures . In particular the battery has to be cooled down and can never fully charge or discharge resulting in wasted capacity. Batteries have three main components - the anode, cathode and electrolyte.

This not only makes them safer for both the consumer and the environment, they are more robust - liquid electrolytes can be easily damaged - and can be used at higher temperatures. Li-ion are extremely sensitive to high temperatures and it can cause them to degrade faster, for instance. Sakti3 has already designed an SSB with an energy density rating - the amount of energy stored it can store - of 1,100 watt hours per litre. This is said to be 50 per cent higher than than current lithium-ion batteries. The firm has also demonstrated its prototype can survive more charge-discharge cycles than traditional Li-ion batteries which typically last two or three years - whether they are used or not. Other companies including Toyota are also working on developing similar technology. Sir James' investment in Sakti3 is part of a larger $20miillion (\u00a313 million) round of investment that will see the technology sold commercially and added to Dyson products. This would include the firm's latest cordless V6 Fluffy designed to work with wooden floorboards, ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring. Sir James said: 'Sakti3 has achieved leaps in performance which current battery technology simply can't. It's these fundamental technologies - batteries, motors - that allow machines to work properly. 'The Sakti3 team has amazing ambitions, and their platform offers the potential for exponential performance gains that will supercharge the Dyson machines we know today.'

A court ruling over a Christian bakery which refused to make a pro-gay marriage cake could lead to Muslim printers being forced to reproduce cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, it has been claimed. Colin and Karen McArthur, owners of Ashers Baking Company, in Northern Ireland, are facing a discrimination claim after they refused to bake a cake featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie under the slogan 'support gay marriage.' But now a leading lawyer has warned that if the case is successful it could set a dangerous legal precedent and undermine freedom of conscience. Aidan O'Neill QC said the case could mean atheist web designers being forced to build a website saying God created the world in six days, or lesbian t-shirt makers being compelled to print shirts saying gay marriage is an 'abomination'. Mr O'Neill posed the hypothetical scenarios in a legal opinion penned ahead of a hearing at Belfast County Court later this month. The case began in May last year after LGBT activist Gareth Lee placed an order for a novelty cake featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie. The design called for the puppets, who are often likened to a gay married couple, arm in arm under the slogan 'support gay marriage'. While the bakery initially took the order and a deposit, Mr Lee was later told they would be unable to comply on religious grounds, and he was refunded his money. Aidan O'Neill QC, a prominent human rights lawyer, has said the case could set a dangerous precedent that could lead to Muslim printers being forced to reproduce Mohammed cartoons (pictured, the cake design) Despite being able to find another baker who completed his request on time and at no extra cost, Mr Lee argues that he has been discriminated against. He is now seeking \u00a3500 in damages in a case which has the backing of\u00a0the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Mr O'Neill has published his legal opinion ahead of the hearing, saying that Mr and Mrs McArthur are 'committed Christians', and that their beliefs should also be protected by discrimination laws. He argues that, by being forced to make the cake the couple would be forced to promote a view they do not hold, which goes against their right to freedom of expression. Mr O'Neill argues that Mr and Mrs\u00a0McArthur are 'committed Christians' and that their right to freedom of expression is also protected under human rights laws (pictured, the couple's bakery) He added: 'This freedom not to be forced or required to express support for a particular opinion or political position was, indeed, the very one which Sir Thomas More strove to uphold in declining to sign the Act of Supremacy declaring Henry VIII to be the Supreme Head of the Church of England.' Colin Hart, director of the Christian Institute which commissioned Mr O'Neill, said: 'The strength and clarity of the advice from Mr O\u2019Neill, who has a national reputation for his human rights expertise, should set off the alarm bells in this Government quango. 'It spells out the very real dangers and far-reaching implications for freedom of speech, but the equality watchdog seems determined to force people to use their creative skills to promote a political cause they fundamentally disagree with.

        "input": "School children around the country will be watching tomorrow's once-in-a-decade solar eclipse on TV due to safety fears. Britain will be thrown into partial darkness around 9.30am tomorrow morning as the moon passes in front of the sun, blocking out up to 98 per cent of its light. But many schools are keeping children indoors when the phenomenon takes place because of fears they could damage their eyes by looking at the sun. The decision by head teachers has angered parents, who want their children to experience the rare celestial event without sitting in front of a screen. Pupils at a number of schools around Britain will be kept indoors tomorrow during the solar eclipse over fears they may damage their eyes by looking at the sun. File photo . Those living in some parts of Britain may not see the eclipse due to the cloudy weather which is forecast . Mother-of-two Jen Palmer, from Worthing, West Sussex, tweeted: 'Hands up who is rebelling against school rules tomorrow and sending their kids in late having watched the eclipse?' And Paul Towner, a father from Reading, Berkshire, wrote: 'Should I take my son to school late so he can watch the Eclipse? They are watching it on TV!' Isabel Stevenson, a mother-of-four from Glasgow, added: 'So not happy about secondary school my kids go to doing NOTHING for solar eclipse tomorrow! Livid and furious. I'm on a mission today.' She has set up a petition calling on her children's school, Greenfaulds High School in Cumbernauld, to do more to mark the occasion. The petition\u00a0states: 'I have been told by the school that they are doing nothing for the event. 'Pupils who are absent from class will be penalised as normal, and the school has no plans in place for viewing the eclipse as it happens, either by video, or by projection. 'Pupils with solar viewing glasses will not be allowed to go outside and use them. '[The school] is dismissing the value that witnessing this rare astronomical event will have on many pupils and it goes against the idea that school is a place of education.' Parents in other areas say they have been left running around after schools only announced today that children would have to bring their own 'eclipse-viewing glasses'. The decision has caused anger among parents, who do not want their children to miss out on the event . Pupils around Britain also went online to complain after some were told the blinds in their classrooms would be closed during the eclipse and others said they would be shown a recording of the event in the afternoon. Oldway primary school in Paignton, Devon, is another one of those which has come under fire for keeping children inside, where they will watch it on computer screens. Parent Sophie Bertorelli said: 'It is a bit of a shame to watch it on a computer. I would have thought they would have maybe supplied some protective glasses.' Head teacher Jane Smythe said she had 700 children to look after and she 'could not guarantee that they would not look at the sun'. Ms Smythe said she understood if parents wanted to keep children at home for the first hour of school so they could watch it together. The school is not the only one to make the decision. The Penryn Primary Academy Cornwall says it is broadcasting the event for children in the school hall, Lasswade Primary School in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian are also keeping students indoors and Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Birmingham is screening it on TV in the afternoon to all but Year 7 students, who will be allowed outside. Oldway Primary School in\u00a0Paignton, Devon, is keeping pupils inside. Its headteacher, Jane Smythe (left) says she cannot guarantee pupils will not look at the sun . Some parent's have back the decision. Fiona Bullman, in Paignton, told the BBC: 'It's too much of a risk. You can't risk 700 children potentially being blinded. Unless there's one adult to one child, you can't [risk it].' The Department for Education has said what schools do for the eclipse is a matter for individual head teachers to decide. Would you let your child watch the solar eclipse? Would you let your child watch the solar eclipse? Now share your opinion . Looking at the sun either with naked eyes or through unfiltered binoculars or telescopes can permanently damage people's eyesight. Those who want to look at the occurrence are being advised to use pin-hole projectors or glasses with special filters. It is feared clouds could also ruin viewing of the eclipse, with overcast skies forecast for much of the south west of England. Northern cities such as Lancaster, York and Newcastle should have sunnier days and Scotland, where the eclipse will conceal almost 98 per cent of the sun in places, will be largely clear. A Met Office spokeswoman said: 'Forecasting exactly where cloud will break and reform is really not scientifically possible. But it's not as thick in the south as further north, so you're more likely to see breaks in the cloud the further south you are.' It is not unknown for a fleeting break in cloud to occur during an eclipse as the atmosphere cools. Another 'deep' partial eclipse visible in the UK will not occur until August 12, 2026, and the next total eclipse not until September 2090. Tomorrow's eclipse will produce a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crosses the North Atlantic and covers only two land masses, the Faroe Islands between Scotland and Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine . Do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse? 'It's all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening, but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes, binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight. 'That's not to say that you can't watch the eclipse on Friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection. 'Dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk. However, unless you already own one, know somebody who does or are looking to get into solar astronomy, they can be a massive investment of several hundred pounds. 'There are cheaper ways to observe the eclipse, though.' Are solar glasses fine to use? 'Many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse. These can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers. 'They work by employing a Mylar film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun's light, allowing you to view the eclipse safely. 'Before using them though, you should make sure that they are not damaged in any way and you should ensure that you have bought them from a reputable dealer. If you're in doubt, don't use your viewers at all.' How can you use a telescope to observe the eclipse? 'If you own a telescope, then there are several ways for you to observe the eclipse. 'If you don't own them already, it is possible for you to buy a solar filter, which covers the aperture of your telescope to ensure that you can observe the sun safely. The movement of the sun and moon means the eclipse will be seen at different times around the UK . 'They are found to be made of glass or as with the solar glasses, Mylar film. It is possible to make a solar filter using Mylar sheets but caution is advised while making your own solar filter - any scratches or pinholes will lead to dangerous amount of sunlight entering your eyes. 'You should also avoid relying on eyepiece filters - they cannot handle the sun's light. 'Telescope projection is also a safe way to observe the eclipse. By using two large, white pieces of card, you can project the eclipse's image onto one piece, while using the other to fit around your telescope's tube to act as a mask to shield your eyes from the sun. 'Focusing your telescope's eyepiece, while holding the second card away, which projects the image, will enable you to show the eclipse to a large group of people safely. 'You should not use a cheap, plastic telescope for telescope projection and ensure that your finderscope has its cap on. 'Never look at the eclipse whilst lining up your telescope with the sun and never leave your telescope unattended. You should also ensure that your instrument doesn't overheat.' Can you use household items to view the eclipse? 'If you don't have a standard telescope or have forgotten to buy a solar viewer, then there are several household items you can use so that you don't miss out on seeing this fantastic event. 'Using a piece of card, or anything that has small holes punched into it, you can project the eclipse onto another piece of card. This is certainly one of the safest ways of viewing the eclipse since you don't need to look at the sun at all. 'A washing up bowl or bucket can also be lined with a black bin liner and then filled with water to make a reflective surface to safely watch the eclipse. When and where will the eclipse be visible? 'The eclipse will begin in the morning. For observers in the UK, the eclipse starts at 8.30am, peaks at 9.35 am and ends at 10.41am, so you should make sure that you know where the Sun rises from your location. 'The total solar eclipse - that's 100 per cent of the Sun's surface covered by the Moon - is visible from the Faroe Islands and Svalbard but if you are unable to get to these locations, many are able to see a substantial partial eclipse - for instance, Scotland will see around 90 per cent of the Sun's disc covered by the moon.' How dark will it get in the UK? 'In London and even in places where there's 90 per cent sun coverage, we're not really going to notice any changes in brightness because there's still a portion of the sun's surface uncovered. 'It'll be like there's a cloud passing over the Sun - you know it's cloudy but it's still light.' This map of the UK shows where the eclipse will be visible and what time it will reach its peak .\n",

Playing near-flawless tennis from the baseline, the Serb broke his opponent twice in each set to coast to victory in just under an hour on the showpiece stadium court at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Fourth seed Andy Murray erased memories of early losses at the venue with a 6-1 6-3 demolition of Canadian Vasek Pospisil and Japanese trailblazer Kei Nishikori recovered from an erratic start to beat American Ryan Harrison 6-4 6-4. World No 1 Novak Djokovic made light work of his first round match at the BNP Paribas Open . Cypriot\u00a0Marcos Baghdatis was no match for the Australian Open champion at Indian Wells . Djokovic, seeking a fourth title at Indian Wells, breezed through the opening set in just 25 minutes before sealing the win when Baghdatis hit a backhand long on the second match point. 'It went very well for me, a very solid performance from the beginning,' the world No 1 said courtside after improving his record this season to 15-2. 'I served well and from the baseline I didn't give Marcos many chances to come back in the match. Great performance against a quality opponent, against somebody that was a former top-10 player and that knows how to play on a big stage. 'Of course, having won the title in Australia, it allows me to have and carry this confidence into every other event that is coming up in the season.' Djokovic takes time out from the tournament to have a kickabout in the sunshine . Andy Murray celebrates his first round victory over\u00a0Vasek Pospisil by hitting a ball into the crowd . Murray broke Pospisil's serve three times in the opening set and twice in the second to ease to victory in 79 minutes on a sweltering afternoon. Ousted in the opening round in 2011 and 2012, the 27-year-old Scot hit 14 winners and won five of his nine break point chances to dominate the match. 'I've struggled a bit in the last few years here so I decided to try and play a very solid match and adjust to the conditions,' world number four Murray said. 'It was very hot and that made the ball pretty lively. 'Controlling the ball isn't that easy. I thought I played quite a smart match.' Kei Nishikori was made to sweat before finishing off local boy\u00a0Ryan Harrison in straight sets . Nishikori, who became the first Asian male to reach a grand slam singles final at the U.S. Open last year, broke Harrison five times while losing his own serve on three occasions before sealing his win in just under an hour and a half. 'It was a bit up and down but I played well in the second set,' said the 25-year-old Japanese. 'I was playing almost a perfect game.' The fifth seed, who lost to Marin Cilic in last year's U.S. Open final before ending a landmark season with four ATP World Tour titles, will next play Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, who beat Australia's James Duckworth 6-2 7-6. In other matches, 10th-seeded Croatian Cilic, back on the circuit after being troubled by a shoulder injury, was upset 6-4 6-4 by Argentine Juan Monaco while eighth-seeded Spaniard David Ferrer battled past Croatia's Ivan Dodig 4-6 6-1 7-6.\n",

        "input": "Manuel Pellegrini's problems are mounting but he refused to concede the title despite suffering a hugely damaging defeat at Anfield. Coming so soon after losing 2-1 to Barcelona in the Champions League City needed a show of character against Liverpool but got the opposite, and the Manchester City manager admitted the performance was not good enough. The defeat leaves City five points behind Chelsea having played a game more, but Pellegrini saw City pull their dream of becoming champions out of the fire last season and he hopes history will repeat itself, even though time is running out. Manuel Pellegrini is refusing to accept defeat in the title race despite seeing Manchester City lose again . Pellegrini (left) looks on despondently as he shakes the hands of Brendan Rodgers (right) at full-time . \u2018I think we never give up about the title,\u2019 said Pellegrini. \u2018We must try to improve our play first and after that try to win our next game. You never know in football what will happen. 'It is more difficult when you have less games and you continue with the same points. \u2018But I don\u2019t think the team can think about that. The team must think about how we can win the next game. 'There were a lot of problems. There were two goals from Liverpool, very good goals in the top corner. We missed three clear chances. It was a close game. \u2018Liverpool played very well and they deserved to win. I am concerned about the whole team. We were playing very well against Stoke and Newcastle. Philippe Coutinho lets fly from range to score the winning goal for Liverpool against City . Hart is left helpless as Coutinho's effort rises above his outstretched hand and hits the back of the net . Liverpool were pegged back as Edin Dzeko finished off a delightful team passing move . 'We start this week against Barcelona and then (here), it was not our team, we cannot lose so many balls with the technical players we have. \u2018That is more important to analyse than the performance of one player. It is more important to think as a team.\u2019 If Pellegrini was disconsolate, Brendan Rodgers was exultant and he hailed Philippe Coutinho\u2019s latest magical display as the Brazilian catapulted Liverpool firmly into the Champions League race. Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in the Barclays Premier League to an 11th game and Coutinho\u2019s role in inspiring the win was crucial, not least when he scored a sublime 75th-minute goal. Coutinho\u2019s influence on the team has grown in recent weeks, with three goals in his last seven appearances, and Rodgers feels the key to this consistency stems from him having peace of mind after signing a long-term contract last month. Liverpool boss Rodgers can't hide his joy at the final whistle as Liverpool edged out City . He had been spared the long trip to Istanbul for the Europa League tie against Besiktas in midweek and the benefits were obvious as his passing and movement tormented Pellegrini\u2019s side. \u2018It was a brilliant result and an equally brilliant performance,\u2019 Rodgers enthused. What made Liverpool\u2019s performance all the more meritorious, according to Rodgers, was that their preparations had been disrupted by the Europa League. They only returned to Merseyside at 4.30am on Friday yet finished the stronger side on Sunday. \u2018It is a big win but we still have a lot of games to go,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018But it is a significant win for us, another three points. 'To prepare yourself for a game against the champions is no mean feat. You have to take your hat off to them, the performance was at a real top level.\u2019\n",
        "output": "Manchester City lost 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday afternoon . The champions are five points behind Chelsea in the Premier League title race - and have also played a game more . Despite that manager Manuel Pellegrini insists his players will never give up on the title despite it now looking improbable they will retain it . Elsewhere, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers hailed his side after the win . The Reds have now taken 20 points from a possible 24 in 2015 .\n"

Remembrance ceremonies were held around the disaster zone and in Tokyo, where Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko led tributes to those who died in Japan's worst peace-time disaster. TV footage showed victims and volunteers joining hands in prayer near the shell of a tsunami-hit building in the port town of Minamisanriku, one of the many stark reminders of the destruction.

Flashback to oblivion: Houses and boats are swept away by a tsunami which was triggered by a 9-magnitude undersea earthquake in 2011 . Crippled: Smoke is seen coming from the No. 3 reactor of the Fukushima Dai'ichi nuclear power plant in Tomioka, Fukushima Prefecture ten days after the tsunami destroyed the complex, forcing thousands to flee the radiation zone . Its gigantic force unleashed a towering wall of water that travelled at the speed of a jet plane to the coast. Within minutes, communities were turned to matchwood and whole families drowned. 'The situation surrounding disaster victims remains severe,' the emperor told the ceremony. 'It is important to continue making efforts to build a safer land without forgetting this lesson.' The National Police Agency said a total of 15,891 people are confirmed to have died in the disaster, with another 2,584 listed as missing. Human remains are still occasionally found. For thousands of relatives, the absence of a body to mourn makes the process of moving on much harder and some continue to carry out their own physical search. 'Somebody needs to do this, walking along the shore,' said Takayuki Ueno, who at the weekend combed a desolate winter beach for the bones of his three-year-old son. In the central coastal town of Shichigahama, 28 police and coastguard officers offered a silent prayer this morning before they began their search for the bodies of two people still missing.

'We have found bones on the beach, but they are mostly from animals,' said Hidenori Kasahara, a police officer who was sifting through the sand. 'We still hope to find (the bodies) for the sake of their families,' he told AFP. The nuclear disaster that the tsunami caused at the Fukushima plant continues to haunt Japan and fuel national debate. The crippled plant remains volatile and the complicated decommissioning process is expected to last for decades. After successfully removing spent fuel rods from a storage pool at Fukushima, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power is still struggling to handle an ever-increasing amount of contaminated water. Japan's entire stable of nuclear reactors were gradually switched off after the disaster.

Buddhist monks offer prayers before an altar at Soma in Fukushima prefecture on March 11, 2015 on the fourth anniversary day of massive earthquake and tsunami hit northern Japan, splintering whole communities and killing nearly 16,000 people . Although Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government and much of industry is keen to get back to atomic generation - largely because of the high costs of dollar-denominated fossil fuels to an economy with a plunging currency - the public is unconvinced. A nuclear watchdog has so far given the green light to refiring four reactors at two plants, but the actual restarts will be delayed until a months-long public consultation is finished and local authorities give their blessing. In the shadow of the Fukushima Daiichi plant on Wednesday, former residents of the nearby evacuated town of Namie placed flowers at a temporary altar and bowed toward the sea.

Fears persist among Japan's population over the effect on health of the radioactive leaks, despite repeated calls from scientists for judgements to be based on evidence. Gerry Thomas, a specialist in thyroid cancer at Imperial College London, who also conducted research on health effects of the 1992 Chernobyl accident, told reporters in Tokyo the worries were disproportionate. 'The health effects caused by the radiation itself were very small, but the health effects that were caused by worrying about the radiation were much, much greater,' she said in Tokyo, referring to post-Chernobyl studies. Despite government pledges of billions of dollars in reconstruction aid, progress in disaster-hit regions has been slow.

How many are doubts for the Ireland match? All of them.\u2019 Jim Hamilton, seen here tackling England's James Haskell, is one of five doubts for the Ireland game . Such was the despondent air hanging over the Scotland head coach as he spoke in the bowels of Twickenham on Saturday evening, he could be forgiven for thinking the worst at the time. Thankfully, a Scottish Rugby Union medical bulletin issued on Sunday suggested it was five players \u2014 not eight \u2014 who will require further treatment ahead of the match at BT Murrayfield. Second row Jim Hamilton, who had to come off for a time after being concussed in the first half, then had to be replaced following a back spasm, is the biggest doubt to face Ireland. Matt Scott suffered a \u2018dead leg\u2019 with bad bruising and now faces a race against time to be ready. Alasdair Dickinson has a leg injury he picked up in a tackle, winger Tommy Seymour an elbow problem and flanker Blair Cowan a calf strain. The walking wounded will be excused training on Monday, with an SRU spokesman saying the medical team will be working with them over the next few days to try to ensure they can put some work in before the final Six Nations match. Vern Cotter was downbeat after the defeat, which came with a heavy price in terms of personell . Others who Cotter thought were more seriously hurt, such as Finn Russell, David Denton and Euan Murray, should be fit. \u2018We have been unlucky with injuries, which hasn\u2019t helped us,\u2019 said Cotter, who lost Alex Dunbar in the build-up to the Calcutta Cup encounter. \u2018Everybody has to be patient. We can turn the corner, come back strong and do well against Ireland. \u2018Right now, we have to take that defeat to England on the chin and keep working, analysing what went wrong, what went right and moving forward. \u2018I thought there were some real positive aspects for us in our game at Twickenham but we have Ireland next week and they beat England \u2014 so it will be very tough test.\u2019 Cotter continues to insist his side are \u2018heading in the right direction\u2019 despite a fourth Six Nations defeat and a likely wooden spoon. Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw takes a heavy hit as he brings down Ben Youngs during the narrow defeat . VIDEO\u00a0O2 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review . He praised his players for battling back against England after losing a fourth-minute converted try from Jonathan Joseph. \u2018England based their strategy on starting well and they did just that,\u2019 added Cotter. \u2018What I saw from our team after that pleased me. I saw great character. They didn\u2019t panic, got themselves back into the match and I got a message down to them to say don\u2019t worry about it. \u2018They also showed they could change tactics when needed, which is a great thing. \u2018On top of that, I thought our line-out defence and our scrum, after the first one, was very good. \u2018If I thought we were being dominated from start to finish I might worry but I don\u2019t think we are. There is more to come from this team, no question.\u2019 Captain Greig Laidlaw was instrumental in dragging Scotland back in the face of England\u2019s early onslaught. He inspired those around him with his leadership qualities. Laidlaw admitted Scotland needed to be more intelligent with the ball, but praised his team's spirit . He gave the backs quick ball and put over two penalties and a conversion in a top-class display. Laidlaw admitted. \u2018England came flying out the blocks but, once that happened, we had to deal with it. \u2018The response I got from the guys was calm and controlled. \u2018From then on, we played some magnificent rugby until half-time. In the second half, a couple of times there was a bounce of the ball that maybe went against us and the game just went away from us a little bit. We should know when to offload and when to hold the ball. \u2018When we did get into their half, we put little kicks through when we should have held the ball. We need to learn that Test-match rugby is won by small margins.\u2019\n",

        "input": "Jeremy Clarkson's future at the BBC is to be decided next week when a report into a 'fracas' with a producer is handed to the director-general. Clarkson was suspended after allegedly punching producer Oisin Tymon during a row after filming over a hot meal at a Yorkshire hotel. The top-rating show was pulled off air while an inquiry was launched. BBC bosses have today said the report will be handed over to the director-general next week. The BBC could have kept Top Gear on air but James May and Richard Hammond refused to go on without their co-host Jeremy Clarkson, it has been revealed . Clarkson (pictured arriving home today) stayed silent today when asked how he felt about a BBC executive allegedly comparing him to Jimmy Savile . The BBC has postponed the remaining episodes of Top Gear following the incident - a move which has seen it lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints . Asked how he felt about the Savile comparisons as he pulled into his driveway, the suspended Top Gear presenter rolled his eyes . The corporation\u00a0reportedly put forward proposals for May and Hammond to continue to present live sections of the show, which would be combined with pre-recorded parts featuring Clarkson, but the two co-hosts refused. An executive from the corporation told The Sun that 'the whole thing had been a nightmare'. Clarkson and producer Mr Tymon have both now talked to an internal inquiry into the Top Gear fracas. Senior BBC executive Ken MacQuarrie has been tasked with sorting out what happened during the incident, but a date for the conclusion of the inquiry is not yet known. But James May scoffed at suggestions he and Richard Hammond were offered the opportunity to host the show without their under-fire colleague Jeremy Clarkson. Reports suggested both had rejected the offer to host Top Gear without their suspended co-host. However, speaking briefly from his west London home today, Mr May said he had not spoken to anybody at the BBC about it, so he hasn't had the opportunity to refuse to do it. He said: 'It's not true. No-one has ever asked me if I was going to do it, there was never any suggestion that we were going to do it. So I've never had an opportunity to refuse to do it. 'I haven't spoke to anybody about it, it's completely new to me - I don't know where it's come from.' Asked if he had spoke to Mr Hammond about hosting the show without Clarkson he said: 'No. But I definitely wasn't offered the opportunity, that's all I really want to say for now.' May made light of the scenario again this morning on Twitter saying 'Once I've done the plumbing, I'm going to fire up Little Honda to see if Norman Tebbit's 'on yer bike' philosophy works. #StillUnemployed.' Clarkson stayed silent today when asked how he felt about a BBC executive allegedly comparing him to Jimmy Savile. Asked how he felt about the Savile comparisons as he pulled into his driveway, the suspended Top Gear presenter rolled his eyes. The BBC has postponed the remaining episodes of Top Gear following the incident \u00a0- a move which has seen it lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints. The top-rating show was pulled off air while an inquiry was launched. BBC bosses have today said the report will be handed over to director-general Tony Hall next week . Clarkson was suspended after allegedly punching producer Oisin Tymon during a row - which took place after filming - over a hot meal at a hotel. The top-rating show was pulled off air while an inquiry was launched . Sunday night's planned episode was replaced by a Red Arrows documentary which pulled in just one million viewers - compared to the five million who regularly tune in for the popular motoring show. Meanwhile, a petition to Bring Back Clarkson has attracted more than 960,000 supporters. Another petition calling on the BBC to hire Alan Partridge, the fictional broadcaster played by Steve Coogan, as the new presenter of Top Gear has also been launched, with almost 20,000 signatures. A BBC spokesman refused to comment on any developments, saying: 'As we said last week we have an investigation ongoing and we won't comment further until that is concluded.' A petition to Bring Back Clarkson (pictured in his black Mercedes today) has attracted more than 960,000 supporters . Blonde events organiser Phillipa Sage was photographed driving away from his flat in west London today . Clarkson was accused of having an affair with her in 2011, and was pictured kissing her on holiday in Greece in 2013 . Spokesmen for Tymon and Clarkson also declined to comment. On Tuesday, the BBC Trust ruled that Clarkson was not being racist when he used the word 'pikey' on Top Gear - a decision which has sparked condemnation from the Traveller Movement. The presenter put up a placard with the words Pikey's Peak on the BBC2 series in February last year. But the Trust's Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) concluded that the word had been used to mean 'cheap', rather than as a term of racist or ethnic abuse. A spokesman for the Traveller Movement rejected the decision, saying: 'We are horrified by the BBC's green lighting of the use of the word 'pikey' by the Top Gear presenters.' Jeremy Clarkson (left), who is currently suspended, and producer Oisin Tymon (right) have both now talked to an inquiry over the Top Gear fracas . Clarkson raised more eyebrows this week when it emerged that in his column in Top Gear magazine, he discussed immigrant taxi drivers in London, saying that their cars smell 'faintly of lavender oil and sick'. The presenter is still scheduled to appear alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at four live Top Gear shows in Norway on March 27 and 28 and a decision on whether to go ahead is expected soon. Outspoken Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has been involved in a string of controversies. Most recently, the BBC Trust ruled that Clarkson was not being racist when he used the word 'pikey' on Top Gear - a decision which has sparked condemnation from the Traveller Movement. The presenter put up a placard with the words Pikey's Peak on the BBC2 series in February last year. He and the Top Gear team were chased out of Argentina after angry locals reacted with fury to Clarkson's number plate containing an apparent reference to the Falklands War. The H982 FKL plate was seen locally as a veiled reference to the 1982 conflict. However, the Top Gear denied their use of it was a deliberate reference to the war, and claimed it had simply been a coincidence. In July, Ofcom ruled Clarkson deliberately used racist language by referring to an Asian man as a 'slope' during a Burma special. The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC in 2012 about a special in which Clarkson travelled round India in a Jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot. Clarkson was also reported to have referred to the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' in 2009. And the year before, the BBC received more than 500 complaints after he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. Clarkson also made a mock Nazi salute while talking about a Mini design that might be 'quintessentially German' and received flak after describing those who jump in front of trains as 'Johnny Suicides'. All three men's contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs, which could render any disciplinary hearings redundant. Clarkson is also expected to record an episode of the BBC's top-rating satire show Have I Got News For You in May. Meanwhile, fellow Top Gear hosts May and Hammond took to Twitter to vent their frustration of being unemployed today. May, 52, tweeted this morning: 'Three light bulbs in our house need replacing. I'm doing it today. #StillUnemployed.' He later continued to make jokes that may have alluded to the fact that the show he hosts alongside Clarkson and Richard Hammond has been put on hold pending an inquiry into the 'fracas'. He tweeted: 'Great news! We also need some new hoover bags. I can spin that out for an hour or two,' followed by a Haiku about his boredom. The motorbike enthusiast, who earlier this week described his co host as a 'knob', wrote: 'Life, once so dazzling\u00a0Sinks into a grey fog of Not-done-it-yourself'. He continued to make light of the amount of free time on his hands, writing: 'Vegetables peel more easily if you wet them, yes. But why? #Unemployed.' 'Seriously, if you really are unemployed, good luck to you. It's not funny in reality.' Then with a picture of the Ferrari badge he tweeted: 'Oh sod it. I'm going for a 'spin.'' He also made what could be interpreted as dark hints about the future of the show earlier in the week, saying: 'Last night, at precisely the moment Top Gear was due to start, the headlights on my car packed up. Not sure where I'm going with this.' Richard Hammond also joined in with the dark hints today, tweeting a picture of a dog alongside a poem. He added: 'Not trying to be cryptic, just enjoying a gorgeous morning. Off..' Jeremy Clarkson, 54, has not been active on Twitter for the past few days, but did change his profile last week to 'I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show, Top Gear.'\n",

        "input": "The interior walls of training complexes are invariably decorated with motivational slogans. Simple truisms to feed the mind on days when the body is weak. For Craig Gordon, the old wisdom \u2013 fail to prepare, then prepare to fail \u2013 is more a way of life than a fleeting thought. To the uninitiated, tomorrow\u2019s final will be settled over 90, maybe 120 minutes, with the lingering possibility of penalty kicks. Celtic keeper Craig Gordon is fully focused ahead of the Scottish League Cup Final with Dundee Utd. But, long before the first ball is kicked in earnest, the Celtic goalkeeper fully expects to be ahead in the battle of wits. While much of what will transpire between Celtic and Dundee United will be random and instinctive, Gordon believes his slavish devotion to studying what\u2019s liable to be thrown at him can significantly shorten the odds on his side coming out on top. \u2018Every game,\u2019 he replied when asked how frequently he\u2019d dip into video analysis. \u2018Free kicks, penalties, the way strikers like to finish the ball, how they strike the ball. \u2018I just look at those things and keep mental notes on how they like to do things and what\u2019s their favourite side. Notes are taken on different players so I know. All of that stuff. Gordon fails to hold the ball allowing Rodrigo Palacio of Inter Milan to score in the Europa League . \u2018It\u2019s about taking that research out on the training pitch, too, and practicing for who you\u2019re going to be playing against - a team that likes to put a lot of low, early crosses into the box, for example. \u2018For the Rangers game, it was deep early crosses hung up to the back post so we focused our training around that. That played out during the game too as I was able to come and take the deep crosses that were taking the pressure off. Between all of us we come up with a plan for the game.\u2019 And when that plan comes together in the form of a victory and a clean sheet? Gordon will be hoping to celebrates his first showcase occasion since\u00a0Hearts earned cup glory in 2006 . \u2018Absolutely, it\u2019s satisfying,\u2019 Gordon added. \u2018It becomes a team effort with Woodsy (Stevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach) and the video analysis guys to ensure we\u2019re as well prepared as possible. And that\u2019s not just me - John Collins does it with midfielders and defenders, so it\u2019s preparation. \u2018What we\u2019re trying to do is make the game as easy as possible for us so we know what we\u2019re coming up against.\u2019 Celtic have not reinvented the wheel with their forensic approach. Nine years ago, Gordon played in the Scottish Cup Final for Hearts against Gretna \u2013 his last major final as it would transpire. Few neutral observers fancied the Borderers to go the distance that day but they did just that. Gordon\u2019s intervention in the final chapter was key, however. As Hearts hit four perfect kicks, he saved from Derek Townsley before watching Gavin Skelton sky the eighth and final kick over the top. Celtic goalkeeper Gordon celebrates their goal during the Scottish Premiership match against Aberdeen . \u2018I had a fair idea of most of the Gretna penalty takers,\u2019 he recalled. \u2018I had seen penalties from them. Most were from memory. With penalties, nowadays everyone does their homework.\u2019 That stop from 12 yards not only allowed Gordon to lift the only major honour of his career to date - it cemented his reputation as one of the finest goalkeepers Scotland has produced. When a \u00a39million move to Sunderland was completed a year later, it seemed he\u2019d spend half his life on the winner\u2019s podium. Little did he realise at the time, how unique those scenes of celebration would prove. A year ago, with the road back from injury seemingly never ending, the chance of another fix of the winning feeling seemed fanciful. \u2018I probably didn\u2019t appreciate at the time like I should have done - playing in a cup final, winning a cup,\u2019 he reflected. Celtic keeper Gordon speaks with referee Craig Thomson after the Scottish Cup quarter final . \u2018Albeit it\u2019s a different competition this Sunday but it\u2019s still to win a cup, I probably did think it would come around again, that I\u2019d get another chance. \u2018I haven\u2019t been close until now so I\u2019m going to enjoy this one a little bit more, but then I\u2019ll only really enjoy it if we win the match. \u2018It\u2019s not something I\u2019ll look back on fondly if we don\u2019t. Certainly I want to take it in a little more this time.\u2019 Gordon is beaten by Rangers striker Nacho Novo during Hearts' 3-2 defeat at Ibrox Stadium in Glagow . Hearts\u2019 2006 Hampden triumph was obviously memorable. Yet lurking just beneath the surface lay a sense of regret. George Burley\u2019s side had started the campaign like a train but being unbeaten and top of the league in October wasn\u2019t enough to shield him from Vladimir Romanov\u2019s axe. John McGlynn took temporary charge before Graham Rix arrived. In time, he was bulleted to make way for Valdas Ivanauskas. Despite the endless turmoil, Hearts still split the Old Firm, with Rangers nudged into third place. There are those in Gorgie who will go to their graves believing they could have gone one better had it not been for in the insanity of the man at the top. Hearts goalkeeper Gordon during the Bank of Scotland Premier League match against Celtic at Celtic Park . \u2018We\u2019ll never know,\u2019 Gordon shrugged. \u2018Would more have been achieved? It may have but it may not. You can speculate but no-one at the time could have told if there was more to come from that group of players. It was still a successful time and one I\u2019ll remember fondly for the rest of my years.\u2019 They were, to put it mildly, colourful days. Romanov\u2019s liking for self-harm culminated in Gordon, Steven Pressley and Paul Hartley taking the unusual step of holding a press conference to air their frustrations. The Riccarton Three, as they were dubbed, all lived to tell the tale. \u2018It was great days playing in a great team and enjoying playing football,\u2019 Gordon reflected. \u2018They\u2019re the things people remember when you finish. Gordon in action during the Tennents Scottish Cup Semi Final between against Celtic at Hampden Park . Gordon and Andrew Driver celebrate in front of the fans as Hearts beat Hibernian 1-0 at Easter Road . \u2018It was a really good team and when that team gets back together it\u2019s a special time for the Hearts fans because they were packing out the ground every week and winning most matches at home and scoring lots of goals. \u2018There was always a downside but on the other side of that we were quite successful on the pitch. It was a good team. \u2018Whatever went on elsewhere was something which didn\u2019t really affect us. That was because of the strength of the characters we had. Gordon throws his gloves in to the crowd following the Premier League match with Kilmarnock . \u2018There are players from that team and some really good characters. Quite a few of that team have gone into management and will probably continue to do so.\u2019 While Hartley, Pressley and Robbie Nielson have done just that, Gordon still has many races to run as a player. Still in contention for three trophies as Celtic\u2019s No1, a nine-year wait to feel a winner\u2019s medal around his neck again could be emphatically bookended in the coming weeks. Ronaldinho celebrates scoring past goalkeeper Gordon during a pre-season friendly at Murrayfield Stadium . \u2018It\u2019s hard, we have played a lot of games already,\u2019 Gordon added. \u2018But that\u2019s something you have to deal with when you\u2019re fighting on so many fronts. Trying to win three trophies is going to take its toll but these are the games you have to get through and recover well between times. \u2018Up until now we\u2019ve managed it pretty well. Even when we\u2019ve not been playing well we\u2019ve still managed to get through and get the results. \u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s part and parcel of having a successful season. It\u2019s something you have to deal with and we will.\u2019 Scottish goalkeeper Gordon in goal for Sunderland after his \u00a39million exit from Hearts back in 2007 . So far, he\u2019s dealt with just about everything that been cast his way. From the cynics that felt signing a long-term crock to replace Fraser Forster would only end one way, to the strikers in Scotland and across Europe who have found him back to his imperious best. It\u2019s not taken long for the smoke signals to be seen down south either. Chelsea have been linked with a move for the 32-year-old as back-up for Thibaut Courtois this summer. But surely Gordon, who effectively still has a two-year tie to Parkhead, has spent enough time watching football these past three years to not voluntarily do so again? \u2018Who says I couldn\u2019t be No1, like?\u2019 he laughed. \u2018It\u2019s flattering but I\u2019ll just concentrate on doing what I\u2019m doing and we\u2019ll see what happens after that.\u2019\n",

        "input": "Oh be still my beating heart. Here we are, standing on the gravel outside the library doors at Highclere Castle, the English stately home in Hampshire that provides the ravishing setting for the television series, Downton Abbey. We are on the very spot where Matthew Crawley asked Lady Mary to marry him in the first Downton Abbey Christmas special, broadcast in 2011. Remember when the violins soared and snowflakes fell? When Matthew got down on one miraculously recovered knee to propose? For many viewers, this was their all-time favourite Downton scene. Scroll down for video . To the manor married: Lady Carnarvon, the real-life equivalent of Downton Abbey\u2019s Cora, in front of Highclere . \u2018Well, that wasn\u2019t my favourite scene!\u2019 cries the Countess of Carnarvon, the current chatelaine of Highclere and the real-life equivalent of Downton\u2019s Cora, who\u2019s Countess of Grantham. \u2018The crew were using ash to recreate the snow. It got inside the house and we had to spend ages dusting and cleaning the rooms. And the smell! Very acrid. We reached the point where we had to stop them doing it.\u2019 Lady Carnarvon has always been quite frank about the travails of letting a film crew loose inside her beautiful home. On the plus side, there are the location fees and increased visitor traffic; the crowds paying \u00a320 a head to goggle at the splendour of her Highclere interiors and the red velvet sofas where the Crawleys gather to take tea. \u2018Yes. It\u2019s like that show, Poke Your Nose Through The Keyhole,\u2019 she says. On the downside, damage and disruption. \u2018I do get annoyed when visitors chuck litter about, but my husband goes around picking it up. We fill black bags with the stuff.\u2019 And since the very first day of Downton filming, when a technician smashed a much-loved green objet de vertu trinket box, she has been on red alert for transgressions. When she is not telling the crew that she pops open the champagne the minute they leave, she is issuing instructions on the correct way to move precious antique furniture. \u2018You lift a girl in your arms and a chair by its bottom,\u2019 she will say. As Carson the butler (\u2018Oh, I adore him, he is divine\u2019) would no doubt agree, the problem with having high standards is that so few manage to live up to them. Another who has incurred her displeasure is Ralph Lauren. The wealthy American designer and his family recently attended a swanky dinner at Highclere, hosted by the Earl and Countess. The Laurens committed the social faux pas of taking numerous photographs of themselves grinning cheesily on the famous Oak Staircase, and elsewhere in sumptuous Highclere, then proudly posting the snaps online. Her ladyship was not best pleased. \u2018My interpretation of dinner is having a meal and his interpretation is taking photographs. It seemed to get out of hand. I have to live with that.\u2019 Has she seen the pictures? \u2018No and I don\u2019t want to, because I don\u2019t want to be irritated by them. My idea of a nice evening is having a conversation, not taking snaps. I have never knowingly taken a selfie, I am useless at photography. I am just . . . different, I suppose.\u2019 The Countess of Carnarvon is the equivalent of Downton\u2019s Cora, played by Elizabeth McGovern . To whizz down the mile-long drive to Highclere Castle is to travel back in time to a more gracious age. The stately home made famous by Downton has been the ancestral seat of the Earls of Carnarvon since 1679. Flanked by elegant pines planted from seed three centuries ago, the house sits in a rolling landscape designed by Capability Brown. To look upon the soaring architecture of Highclere is to understand the ambition and conceit of the old English upper classes, who once thought that life behind these ramparts of Bath stone, surrounded by Reynolds, Van Dycks and walls covered in green French silk, would go on for ever. Yet even the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by Lord and Lady Grantham in the fictional series is far removed from the realities of today. My dears, in the real Downton, the current chatelaine doesn\u2019t even have a lady\u2019s maid. \u2018Certainly not!\u2019 she says. \u2018And sadly not, because I would absolutely love one.\u2019 In this house, with more than 300 rooms and \u2018about 80\u2019 bedrooms, the servants\u2019 bellboard is still there outside the kitchen, just as it was over 100 years ago. But now, instead of tinkling bells, estate staff are summoned by the crackling walkie-talkie her ladyship carries in her hand. Here, amid her six dogs, her horses, her staff and her husband, Lady Carnarvon gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme. She was Fiona Aitken before she married Geordie Herbert, the Queen\u2019s godson and soon to be eighth Earl of Carnarvon, 16 years ago. Fiona was a foxy blonde and arch Sloane Ranger. The eldest of six sisters, she was raised in Fulham, West London, and is a trained accountant who once designed and sold crushed velvet evening wraps to other Sloanes. Only two years after they married, she and Geordie took over Highclere when the seventh Earl died. \u2018Then you understand that you marry the man and the house,\u2019 she says today. While her husband runs the estate, the jolly, sporty 52-year-old has become the face and force of the real Downton, in charge of monetising the legacy from the popular TV show. In this, she has been enormously successful, writing two best-selling books about previous Carnarvon wives; Almina and Catherine. Lady Carnarvon gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme, much like Dame Maggie's Dowager Countess of Grantham . She also gives talks all over the world. In Texas next month, the socialite Lynn Wyatt is hosting a champagne Highclere Tea where Texan fans of Downton can meet the countess over cake, all for the price of a \u00a3440 ticket. She is quite the draw, happy to take on the ambassadorial role while her husband stays in the background. Right on cue, Lord Carnarvon appears in his Dad jeans and trainers, coffee mug in hand. Seeing that the morning room where we are talking is occupied, he quietly reverses out the door, like a dog in a Crufts obedience trial. \u2018He is very shy,\u2019 his wife explains. No one, least of all the couple themselves, imagined that Downton Abbey would be so successful. Now screened in more than 100 countries, it brings Americans and Chinese visitors here in droves. \u2018Who would have thought an Edwardian drama beginning in 1912 would have such huge appeal?\u2019 she wonders. Who indeed, but shooting began this week on the sixth Downton series. \u2018I am sure they would like to go on making more series,\u2019 she says. ITV director Peter Fincham has told her that he wants Downton to go on for 18 years. \u2018That made me gulp.\u2019 The money that flows into the Highclere coffers as a result of the series must surely, however, cushion the blow of domestic disruption. After all, before Downton hit our screens, the Carnarvons admitted that their estate needed \u00a311.75 million of repairs, including \u00a31.8 million of urgent work on the main house. Although the family will not say how much money they get for the rental of the castle for filming, Lord Carnarvon has since said the show had \u2018taken the pressure off\u2019 them financially. There is also talk of a Hollywood film, which Lady C does not deny. \u2018I try not to lie awake at night worrying about money,\u2019 she says. \u2018Obviously, like everyone else, I have a sense of complete panic every so often. I am not in a position where I have so much money I worry about what to do with it.\u2019 On sleepless nights, she roams the Highclere corridors, and likes to sleep in her son\u2019s bed when he is at boarding school. She soothes herself by listening to the Shipping Forecast on Radio 4, feeling grateful that she is not \u2018alone in a boat on the ocean\u2019. Lady Carnarvon first met her husband at a dinner party where they bonded over a love of World War I poetry. Her former lover, an eccentric cove called Sir Benjy Slade, had sued her for the return of a pet labrador and claimed she was \u2018the ruthless golddigger of the year\u2019. Highclere Castle, the English stately home in Hampshire, provides the ravishing setting for Downton Abbey . It\u2019s far more likely that the Carnarvons were two slightly broken people who made each other complete. He had recently separated from his first wife and two young children; she was grieving over the early death of both her parents. They married in February 1999 and had their son Edward in October; a honeymoon baby for a gilded life. It is to her credit that she does all her work on Highclere in the full knowledge that it is her husband\u2018s son, not hers, who will inherit the Carnarvon title and all the lands. Edward gets nothing, but that does not bother her. \u2018I am not worried. If I make some money from books, that is his. In life it is not what you take, it is what you give that matters most.\u2019 She and Geordie appear to have a healthy working partnership, one that she describes as \u201850/50 with a one per cent swing either way.\u2019 They eat breakfast, lunch and dinner together every day and never get tired of each other. Heaven for them is supper on a tray in front of the television. Her transition from confident and capable young woman to countess is fascinating. \u2018I would hate to be considered snobbish,\u2019 she says, although she learned, in the upper class way, to use charm as a weapon to get what she wants. \u2018You could walk into somewhere like Highclere and just stand like a petrified creature in the headlights, doing nothing. Or you could take it one step at a time. It is the end, not the journey, that matters.\u2019 A journey that sometimes takes in some aggravating neighbours along the way. \u2018I am a woman,\u2019 she says, \u2018who knows which battles to fight.\u2019\n",

She was given the prestigious job as head nun at the Jingzhou Tienv Temple in central China's Hubei Province, but it was also wanted by rival Xi Jing, who now stands accused of attacking Wei Hui to put her out of action. Buddhist nun Wei Hui pictured lying in the gutter and covered in blood following the alleged assault . She was then taken to hospital, where she said a medical report proved she had been badly injured . Wei Hui, 39, who is still in hospital, said she released the picture of her after being badly beaten to media because her religious leaders were refusing to take action over what had happened and were not treating it seriously, The People's Daily reported.

There is a medical report that confirms I was badly hurt, yet there seems to be some suggestion that it was my fault that I ended up like this.' Wei Hiu's medical report, which showed she had suffered serious injuries in the alleged assault . Her rival Xi Jing, 41, meanwhile says that the allegations that she was the one who was responsible for the attack are nonsense, despite the fact Wei Hui claimed to have identified her. She said: 'Wei Hui is merely unhappy that I was asked to take over while she recovered in hospital. 'The fact that I had been offered the chance to stand in for her was clearly proof that our religious superiors believe the allegations were nonsense.' According to Buddhist scriptures, the order of bhikkhunis or female nuns was first created by Buddha five years after he created the first Buddhist monk. Although the female order eventually died out, it was reinstated in 2007 after a congress held in Germany with representatives from Buddhist countries all round the world. Zhao Yongqin, the director general of Jingzhou national religious affairs management institutions, when contacted for comment claimed to be unaware of the fact that Wei Hui had been beaten despite the medical report testifying to her injuries.\n",

That's the message out of Indonesia, where national search and rescue chief Bambang Soelistyo announced that the main search-and-recovery operation surrounding doomed commercial airliner AirAsia Flight 8501 officially ended Tuesday. \"These past two months have been the hardest times for all of us at AirAsia and for the families of QZ8501 passengers,\" AirAsia Indonesia CEO Sunu Widyatmoko said. \"No words can express how grateful we are for all the prayers, love and support given us.\" He was referring to the nightmare that the airline and, especially, the loved ones of the 162 people on board the Airbus A320-200 jet have been experiencing since its crew lost contact with air traffic controllers on December 28. Indonesian Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan later explained the plane climbed rapidly, then stalled shortly before it crashed. Unlike Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared a year ago and still hasn't been located, there has been less mystery and more closure over Flight QZ8501. That's because searchers did find remnants from the AirAsia aircraft and the remains of some passengers in the Java Sea. That included the jetliner's fuselage, the last major piece of which was recovered late last month and brought into a Jakarta port earlier this week. As of Tuesday, authorities had identified the bodies of 94 who had been on the AirAsia plane, with six other bodies still in Surabaya's Bhayangkara Hospital. Yet that leaves scores of other families still waiting. The decision to call off the main search stems from the fact no more human remains were found in the past week, Soelistyo explained. But that doesn't mean authorities won't be looking at all. There will be a smaller-scale operation, involving divers and three vessels, over the next week, according to Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency. After that, the plan is to call off the search entirely.\n",

Australian journalist Peter Greste (above) has thanked Foreign Minister Julie Bishop for using her 'laser-like eyes' to secure his release from an Egyptian prison, comparing her to the Terminator . Mr Greste continued, bringing up a touching moment when he saw Ms Bishop speaking on the steps of Parliament House while he was still in prison serving his 400 days. 'I remember being quite shocked, quite surprised by how emotional you seemed and also upset and angry in a way that you don\u2019t often hear from a politician,' he said. 'It took me a moment for the penny to drop that actually you were talking about me. This was on the day after our conviction and that was a very emotional moment.'

Mr Greste addressed the minister, thanking her for her involvement in his case and her constant pioneering for his release. 'Your personal involvement and the involvement of a lot of Australia's politicians really made\u00a0a difference to all of us in prison because it meant that our cause wasn't personal. 'It wasn't just about us against the Egyptian government - we had the backing of the entire Australian government and indeed the Australian people and that meant more than you can possibly imagine,' he said. The 49-year-old Al Jazeera journalist landed back on Australian soil in early February after spending 400 days in jail. He was convicted in 2013 after being accused of helping the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed terrorist organisation, due to their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi.

During his speech, Mr Greste \u00a0brought up his ongoing trial and that of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed. 'The way that this trial seems to be going is encouraging' Mr Greste said. 'We've learned to take nothing for granted. Things are positive, we know we've done nothing wrong and we've broken no law.'

        "input": "Within minutes of the final whistle at every Champions League tie, the two managers are in possession of a full statistical analysis of the match. Sadly, the temptation is still to look at the scoreline. At the sharp end of European football English teams cannot keep the ball. On the continent, this is considered to be a crime. It is the primary reason all four English teams - Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City - were eliminated from the Champions League before the quarter-final draw. Manchester City's players leave the Nou Camp looking glum after being eliminated from Champions League . Lionel Messi stole the show on Wednesday, taking 116 touches, 42 more than any other City player . Manchester City had goalkeeper Joe Hart to thank for keeping the score to just one at the Nou Camp . Messi joins in the celebrations with goalscorer Ivan Rakitic and Luis Suarez during the first half . Will we ever learn? Probably not. Over two legs in the Champions League second round, Manchester City did not have a single player who touched the ball on more than 74 occasions. It is pitiful. Where was David Silva? Where was Samir Nasri? Where was Yaya Toure? Nowhere, absolutely nowhere. In the Nou Camp on Wednesday, when Barcelona won 1-0 and it would not have flattered them had they scored eight, nine or 10, Lionel Messi touched the ball 116 times. That\u2019s what we are in the game for, to be spellbound by players who want to make things happen with a clever twist or spin or flick. At the Etihad, when Barcelona won 2-1 in the first leg, Messi settled for 107 in the Premier League champions\u2019 backyard. James Milner was City\u2019s highest with 64. Martin Jol always encouraged his players to \u2018be the boss of the ball\u2019 when he was head coach at Tottenham. English football still looks to be terrified of it. Former Tottenham manager Martin Jol always encouraged his players to 'be the boss of the ball' Pep Guardiola's Bayern are joint top for passing accuracy with Barca (89.2 per cent) this season . To those who followed the fortunes of the four English teams in the Champions League, it will not come as a surprise to anyone that none of them are in the top five for passing accuracy. Barcelona, who toyed with City during Wednesday\u2019s 1-0 victory in the second leg, are joint top with Pep Guardiola\u2019s Bayern Munich (89.2 per cent). Next come 10-time champions Real Madrid (88.3), followed by Paris Saint Germain (88.1) and another team entrenched in the obsession with possession, Ajax (87.5). The elite teams rely on possession, keeping the ball in circulation until they can carve out an opening and move in for the kill. We will hear some tripe over the next few days, with people convinced that we must continue to refine a mangled, hybrid system to suit English football. Well 40 years in and it\u2019s not working. Arsenal were dumped out on Tuesday despite being favourably drawn against Monaco in the last 16 . Arsene Wenger saw his Arsenal side crash out of the Champions League despite a 2-0 win in the second leg . Our national team went out of a World Cup in Brazil without even winning a game because they couldn\u2019t keep the ball in an average group comprising Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica. At Euro 2016, even with some of weakest teams in European football at the table, England will fail dismally because of their inability to retain possession. Our Champions League teams are heading the same way because they are incapable of flipping between the demands of the Premier League and the tactical subtleties of European football. At this point there will be those who cite the classic counter-attacking teams, such as Jose Mourinho\u2019s Inter Milan (2010) and Roberto Di Matteo\u2019s Chelsea (2012), who went on to win the European Cup. They are the exception, not the rule. Barcelona\u2019s chasing of Manchester United in Rome (2009) and the more humiliating defeat at Wembley (2011) was another wake-up call for English football. Sadly, we forgot to set the alarm. Talk to Barcelona\u2019s players and they are happy to share the secrets of the Champions League, the magic formula that has been refined over the years at their training ground on the outskirts of the city. Chelsea were eliminated by PSG despite Jose Mourinho's side having a one-man advantage for 90 minutes . David Luiz celebrates after his header took the tie to extra-time before PSG went through on away goals . Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool were sent crashing out at the group stage of the Champions League . A dejected Raheem Sterling slumps to the floor after a 1-1 draw at home to Basle sealed Liverpool's fate . \u2018When we have the ball we keep it at all costs,\u2019 admitted Andres Iniesta ahead of Wednesday\u2019s second leg at the Nou Camp against Manuel Pellegerini\u2019s team. \u2018And when we lose it, we do everything we can to win it back.\u2019 Iniesta has won the European Cup three times - in 2006, 2009 and 2011 - since he broke into the Barcelona team under the Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard. Spain\u2019s World Cup winner knows his stuff. Barcelona have two speed settings - quick, and very quick - and their entire system is designed to provoke the opposition into making mistakes. City routinely gave the ball away within five seconds. Arsenal (57.1 per cent) are the only English team to feature in the top five clubs who keep the ball in the Champions League this season. In the Stade Louis on Tuesday they moved through the gears, with Santi Cazorla (141 touches) and Mesut Ozil (126) running the show in their impressive 2-0 victory. England failed to make it out of their modest World Cup group in Brazil last summer . England manager Roy Hodgson watches on in anguish as his side are beaten 2-1 by Uruguay . Joao Moutinho, so influential for Monaco in the first leg, fell short in the centre of their midfield with 72 touches. His midfielder partner Jeremy Toulalan had 56. Bayern (67 per cent), who are moving into a new phase of possession-based football under Guardiola, head the list of teams dominating games, followed by Barcelona (64), Porto (60.9) and Juventus (59.6). Those four teams, possibly the most entertaining to watch in the competition this season, are all in the draw for the quarter-final. This stuff is staring us in the face and yet we will choose to ignore it because we will be back in thrall with the thrills and spills of the Barclays Premier League this weekend. We love its combative nature, the ability to throw up surprises because of its rugged composition, an unpredictable mix of styles, and its raw pace. For English football to succeed in Europe, the top teams must evolve, playing a possession-based game and learning to pick their moment in the biggest matches. Until they do, we all know the score.\n",

Take combustible issues like religion and sexuality, stir in a new law and talk of a boycott, then -- boom! -- the debate on social media explodes. And so it has proved with Indiana's new \"religious freedom\" law, signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Pence. The new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner's religious beliefs. Supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose. Opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty. The debate is nothing if not vitriolic. And colorful, too. \"Libs SHUTUP,\" reads one tweet, which goes on to assert that Indiana's \"Relgious Freedom Restauration Act (sic)\" is modeled on federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. People on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and, it seems for the moment, more numerous. Some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people, if perchance their religion dictated that. Others say that Indiana seems out of step with modern times. And then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that, law or no law, they have no intention of turning anyone away. \"My team just canceled travel to IN due to the #ReligiousFreedomRestorationAct,\" tweeted a user under the name Mark C Somerville, who says he works for @salesforce. \"We stand against discrimination.\" And a tweet from a the St. Elmo Steak House, a business in Indianapolis, the state's capital and its largest city, pledged in capital letters to continue serving ALL. The word Freedom should only be used when it's inclusive and fair for all. Supporters of the law, however, made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott. \"Before you go and get too self-righteous w/ your #BoycottIndiana,\" a user called Caleb Parke tweeted, \"@GovPenceIN is protecting #religiousfreedom for EVERYONE! #EqualRights.\"\n",
        "output": "Social media supporters of Indiana's \"religious freedom\" bill say it protects their right to hold their own beliefs. Opponents of the bill say its \"freedom\" is a cover for bigotry against gays and lesbians. Some Indiana businesses tweet that they will continue to serve all customers, regardless of orientation. Some users take to social media in attempt to organize boycott of Indiana .\n"

        "input": "The case of the 'Gone Girl' physiotherapist and her boyfriend who were accused of staging her kidnapping has taken another strange twist \u2013 a group who are claiming to be the kidnappers have demanded an apology from the police. Densie Huskins, 29, was allegedly snatched from her home by kidnappers who tied her boyfriend up on March 23, then released one day later 400 miles away beside her parents' home. After her \u2018release\u2019 police accused them of staging the kidnapping \u2013 a claim they both strongly denied. Now the San Francisco Chronicle has received a string of anonymous emails from the apparent kidnappers in which they compare themselves to the cast of Ocean's 11 and claim they will strike again. Scroll down for video . The self-proclaimed kidnappers behind the Gone Girl abduction of Denise Huskins (second from right with her mother and two brothers) are demanding police apologize for calling the incident a hoax . In an email to the San Francisco Chronicle, the group threatens the Vallejo Police Department anbd spokesman Lt. Kenny Park (above) that they will 'cause harm' if Huskins faces criminal charges . They also say they monitored Huskins' boyfriend Aaron Quinn (above) after the kidnapping so he would not go to police, which is why he did not call authorities for 12 hours . In an email the kidnappers write; 'I/we may be the direct agent of harm. But it will be made crystal clear that the Vallejo Police Department, and you, Mr. [Kenny] Park, had every opportunity to stop it.' Last week Lt. Park, the spokesman for the Vallejo Police Department, said that the kidnapping of Huskins, which triggered a statewide search that involved 100 volunteers, 40 detectives and numerous FBI agents, was \u00a0an 'orchestrated event.' The letter to the\u00a0Chronicle\u00a0says authorities have until noon on Tuesday to apologize. It also demands that the police make clear that neither Huskins or her boyfriend Aaron Quinn - who was with her at the time she was allegedly kidnapped but waited 12 hours to call police - will face any criminal charges. As for the main reason behind the kidnapping, they write; 'The Mare Island kidnapping was a training mission to test means and methods that would be used on higher net worth targets.' They then compare themselves to the cast of Ocean's 11, the famous caper film that starred members of the Rat Pack when it premiered in 1960 and Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and George Clooney in the 2001 remake. It is not the first email the alleged kidnappers have sent the paper either, also reaching out to them on March 24 with an audio file of Huskins to prove she was still alive one day after being taken from her home in Mare Island. She eventually turned up in Huntington Beach, where both of her parents live, just a few hours later. This latest email, sent on Saturday from a dummy account, was 9,000 words long, and detailed why the group kidnapped Huskins, and how they went about taking her from her home. The group consists of three members, two with college educations, and they claim they are also behind a recent string of burglaries and car thefts in the area. They claim they drilled holes in the window of Huskins and Quinn's home to gain entry, and then used squirt guns with 'strobe flashlights and laser pointers' attached to them to make it appear as if they were firearms. They say they played 'calming music' as they went about the abduction, and put monitors on Quinn, 30, so they could make sure he did not go to police. They then say they put Huskins in the trunk of Quinn's car and drove off with her. The group of three people claim they drilled a hole in a window of Huskins and Quinn's home (above) and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take Huskins . The kidnapping, which has been called an 'orchestrated event' by authorities, has drawn comparisons to the film Gone Girl (above) In the end however, they claim it was a case of mistaken identity, and they did not mean to take Huskins, thinking that someone else would be in the house. They say that is why they decided to drop her off in Huntington Beach and that they were 'horrified at what we had done.' As for the ransom they requested, what police believe to be a rather paltry $8,500, the group said; 'We chose $8,500 because it was below the $10,000 reporting threshold, and far enough below that it likely would not be flagged as part of a structured transaction under that prong of the reporting law.' Attorneys for both Quinn and Huskins claim that their clients have confirmed aspects of this email, and that they have sent photos of the holes drilled in the window that the kidnappers used to gain access to prove that whoever sent this note is telling the truth. Huskins' attorney, Doug Rappaport, said that the reason police called the incident a hoax is because the kidnappers used 'sophisticated computer skills' that neither they or the FBI could 'comprehend.' Lt. Park, the Vallejo Police Department and the FBI all have yet to comment on the emails.\n",

The Liverpool striker talks about his upbringing, his club team-mates and why he doesn't blame Roy Hodgson for his five-month injury lay-off. Daniel Sturridge describes himself as a 'very closed-off person' but here in an exclusive interview with Sportsmail he opens up about his life on-and-off the field. As the Reds prepare for Monday's Premier League trip to Swansea, the 25-year-old striker talks about his upbringing, his club team-mates and why he doesn't blame Roy Hodgson for his five-month injury lay-off. Here,\u00a0Sportsmail gathers the best 10 quotes from our Sturridge interview. Daniel Sturridge tells Sportsmail his thoughts on Mario Balotelli, Steven Gerrard and his injury problems . Sturridge on Mario Balotelli . 'In football you meet people who are cool guys and he is one of those guys. He is a young guy who just wants to live his life. Anyone at the age of 24, if you put a microscope on them for a few months and see how they are living, it would probably be far worse than Mario. He is a normal guy. Footballers are put on a pedestal of not being human but we are just normal people. I am a normal dude.' Mario Balotelli (left) has been described as a 'cool guy' by Sturridge, despite a difficult start at his new club . Sturridge on Steven Gerrard . 'This guy is a living legend. Words can't describe what he has done not just for the club but for the players as well. He helps players settle in, young players. He takes them under his wing. We will never be able to repay him for that. His stature and his demeanour will be very difficult to replace but we have to. It will take time. That guy will always be a legend in my eyes. I am in awe of him now.' Sturridge (right) has hailed departing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (centre) as a 'living legend' of the club . Sturridge on strikers . 'Why am I watching someone else's glories and achievements? It doesn't matter to me who comes around or what players are about. It means nothing to me. When you watch other people, you don't get anywhere in life because you are at war with yourself. Well done to Harry Kane and what he has achieved, but I am not watching what he is doing. I just believe in me.' Harry Kane has had a scintillating season at Tottenham scoring 26 goals in all competitions so far . Sturridge on England injury . 'Regardless of what happened in the past, I love playing for England,\u2019 says Sturridge. \u2018That situation occurred and it\u2019s in the past. I don\u2019t want to dwell on it. People pick injuries up and they are unfortunate. It just so happened I got injured that day. It\u2019s life. People get injured sometimes. It is what it is.' Sturridge's five-month injury lay-off began when he damaged thigh muscles while on England duty last year . Sturridge on Roy Hodgson . \u2018My relationship with the England manager is top class. No worries at all. We speak via input. We speak to each other. We keep in touch. Throughout my injury, he kept in touch. I would never blame him for this. Never. Or any of the staff - it was just an unfortunate incident. I have got so much respect and admiration for him and his set-up. The relationship is very, very good.' Despite the injury, Sturridge (right) says his relationship with England manager Roy Hodgson as 'top class' Sturridge on his personal life . 'I'm a very closed-off person,' says Sturridge. 'I can count my friends on one hand. Everyone has acquaintances, workmates and so on, but apart from that, I just have my family and a close-knit group of people around me. 'Why closed-off? I think it is down to childhood. When you grow up in certain environments, you can't be too loud or too open because you can be exposed to things you don't want to be exposed to. Where I grew up there was crime and there were other things.' Despite his extrovert celebration, the 25-year-old striker describes himself as a 'very closed-off person' Sturridge on Birmingham gang culture . 'There was a gang culture when I was growing up in Birmingham. It was easy to stay away from it because the football was there but that\u2019s the reason why I have never been open. 'It becomes second nature to be like that. I had to be wary. At all times. 'The gang stuff wasn\u2019t based on colours - it was more about areas. You might be a family friend of someone who was involved with something. I was never involved in anything like that and I enjoyed growing up there.' Sturridge on faith . 'I am grateful to God for everything that I have had in the past and everything I will have in the future,' he says. 'You have setbacks, you have comebacks, you have glories, you don't have glories. Not everything is going to be rosy and sweet all the time. There are going to be times in your life when you go through certain situations that test your character, test your courage, test your faith, test your self-belief, test everything.' Sturridge grew up in Hockley in the inner city Birmingham where he kept to himself to himself as a child . Sturridge on USA injury rehabilitation routine . 'I am getting up at 7am and I am finishing at 4 or 5pm. I\u2019m tired. It\u2019s dark by then. The sun\u2019s not out. I went back to my room, ate. Then I played some dominoes and went to bed.' Sturridge on his dream dinner date with four sportsmen . 'Muhammad Ali, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and Diego Maradona. I prefer Pele to Maradona as a player but I\u2019d have Maradona for the laughs.' Argentina great Diego Maradona (centre) would be included in Sturridge's dream sportsmen dinner date .\n",

        "input": "U.S. narcotics agents with Top Secret clearances had wild 'sex parties' with prostitutes hired by Colombian drug cartel members, according to a blockbuster report from the Justice Department's internal investigations arm. The Drug Enforcement Agency has yet to comment on the findings in the expos\u00e9 from the DOJ's Office of Inspector General. At least seven DEA agents admitted to investigators that they had sex with hookers while on overseas assignments. But instead of firing or prosecuting them, the agency treated their cases as a 'local management issue' and suspended them for between 2 and 14 days. The IG cautioned in the report, released Thursday morning, that U.S. law enforcement personnel who engage in illicit sex \u2013 even in places where it's legal or unofficially tolerated \u2013 can be vulnerable to 'coercion, extortion, and blackmail.' The Republican chairman of the congressional panel that specializes in inter-governmental investigations lobbed rhetorical bombs at the Justice Department after the report surfaced online, calling its allegations 'truly stunning.' 'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE REPORT . TROUBLE IN COLOMBIA: Drug Enforcement Agency officers had hooker parties allegedly paid for with drug cartel money . NARCO-PERVS: DEA agents had Top Secret clearances when they went on sex romps with hookers . 'We need to hold them accountable and, given the clear evidence in the OIG report, they should be fired immediately,' he said of the offending agents. 'We need to weed out those who risk our national security, embarrass the county, and skirt the law.' Chaffetz promised that his panel, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 'will pursue this vigorously' after next week's congressional recess. In all, the IG report flagged 621 cases where agents in the FBI, DEA, ATF and U.S Marchalls Service were accused of a wide variety of sex-related offenses. They ranged from sexting and sexual liaisons between supervisors and subordinates to the consumption of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors and prison imnates. In the prostitudion cases, the IG wrote, 'DEA supervisors treated the alleged misconduct as a local management issue' even though the 'these special agents held Top Secret clearances.' One case involved agents 'patronizing prostitutes and frequenting a brothel while in an overseas posting. ... It was also alleged that one of the subjects in the supervisors\u2019 group assaulted a prostitute following a payment dispute.' 'The Acting Assistant Regional Director who supervised the two special agents in this case,' investigators wrote, 'was also alleged to have solicited prostitutes ... In that case, the AARD allegedly engaged in sexual relations with prostitutes at a farewell party in the AARD\u2019s honor.' 'There were also allegations operational funds were used to pay for the party and the prostitutes who participated.' In all, six hookers attended that soiree. Supervisors allegedly knew about it but never referred the case to the DOJ for disciplinary action. A tipster ultimately blew the whistle on two of the agents, claiming in an anonymous letter to DEA higher-ups that they had frequented prostitutes on a regular basis while on oversead tour-of-duty assignments. In a separate case, the inspector general describes DEA agents who attended prostitute 'sex parties arranged by a Colombian law enforcement officer and funded with money from drug cartels themselves. The parties, the IG said, happened in the agents' government-leased apartments over a period of several years. Agents' laptops, BlackBerry devices, and other government-issued equipment were typically lying around, creating 'potential security risks' and potentially making agents vulnerable to 'extortion, blackmail, or coercion.' Foreign officers later claimed they held on to the American agents' guns while they were indulging in the hooker-fests. They also claimed they gave three DEA supervisory agents 'money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members.' Ultimately, 7 of the 10 agents the IG interviewed admitted taking part in the 'sex parties.' They were suspended for between 2 and 10 days, but never prosecuted criminally. Overall, the DEA limited its punishment to a maximum of 14 days, in part because Colombian authorities generally turn a blind eye to the sex trade. 'The DEA Inspector told us that prostitution is considered a part of the local culture and is tolerated in certain areas called \"tolerance zones\",' the GI wrote. 'According to the Inspector, it is common for prostitutes to be present at business meetings involving cartel members and foreign officers.' ANGRY:\u00a0'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz . The DOJ's inspector general found a wide range of sex-related offenses in the case files of the FBI, DEA, ATF and US Marshals Service, including sex with prostitutes and sexual assault of minors . The U.S. Marshalls Service also got a black eye in the inspector general report. In one 2010 case described in detail, two deputy marshalls traevled to Thailand to pick up a criminal defendant who was being extradited to the United States. Every time the State Department tried to contact one of the men, one of two women with foreign accents would answer his phone and say he couldn't be disturbed. 'A local investigator for the State Department spoke to one of the women in Thai' and 'confirmed she was a prostitute,' the IG wrote. When he got home, the deputy was forbidden to travel overseas again. But he fuond a way to conduct at least one more extradition mission anyway and kept his security clearance. A nother deputy 'entered into a romantic relationship' with the spouse of a fugitive criminal suspect. When his supervisors told him to break off the fling, it took him a year to do it. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was relatively unscathed by the IG investigation, with one glaring exception. An ATF Director of Industry Operations, investigators wrote, 'solicited consensual sex with anonymous partners and modified a hotel room door to facilitate sexual play.' Management at the hotel caught him disabling a fire detection system; he insisted he had done it before with no problem. Separately, an FBI Assistant Section Chief who trained his fellow agents on child exploitation and human trafficking issues 'engaged in multiple consensual and commercial sexual encounters over a 7-year period,' according to the report. His partners included 'foreign nationals, including prostitutes, strippers, students in his classes, and members of foreign law enforcement.'

Its president, Dr Hilary Cass, called for the government to take action as Britain has the highest rate of childhood obesity in Western Europe. She said that focus on care for the elderly should not mean that issues surrounding children's health should fall by the wayside. The survey found more than three-quarters of people said that child death rates, reducing rates of childhood cancer and ensuring consistent health service provision for children and young people should be the top child health priorities for government. Dr Cass said: 'We often see policies hitting the headlines that are targeted at the ageing population - increased funding for dementia research and additional dementia training for NHS workers are among the pledges that have been made in recent weeks.

        "input": "(CNN)A Louisiana judge ruled Monday that Robert Durst, the millionaire real estate heir charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail. That's no big surprise. In 2001 -- the last time he was accused of murder and released on bail -- Durst fled to Pennsylvania, where authorities caught him after he tried to shoplift a sandwich from a supermarket. As the attorneys sparred in court and witnesses testified Monday, they revealed new details about the investigation that led to Durst's March 14 arrest, and set the stage for what will surely be a fierce legal battle. After the hearing, Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, spoke with CNN's Jean Casarez. Here are some key details from Monday's hearing and the interview: . Durst, who appeared in court wearing an orange prison uniform and shackles, was arrested after federal agents tracked his cell phone, according to information presented in court Monday. Investigators knew he'd left his Houston condo with five suitcases on March 10. And, since a warrant allowed them to track his cell phone, they saw when it pinged a tower 85 miles east, in Beaumont, Texas. But suddenly, he had stopped using it. Investigators thought the trail had gone cold. \"They had no indication of his movement,\" said Jim O'Hearn, an investigator for the Orleans Parish district attorney's office. But then, authorities tracked him to New Orleans after he called his voice mail twice from a Marriott there, O'Hearn testified. That's where FBI agents found and arrested him. Last week, court documents revealed Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, 5 ounces of marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a neck-to-head latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash, mostly in $100 bills. Among his possessions, he also had a UPS tracking number. The package was later intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said in court Monday. It contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. It's a case Durst even has made himself. In \"The Jinx,\" the HBO documentary that featured him, Durst said: \"You can't give someone charged with murder bail because they're going to run away, of course. Goodbye, $250,000. Goodbye, jail. I'm out.\" In a seconds-long news conference after the hearing Monday, Durst attorney DeGuerin said he had no hope for bail and the judge's decision was not surprising. The legal team, however, did obtain \"a lot of information,\" he said, and a preliminary hearing was set for April 2. \"All in all, I think this has been a very good day for us,\" he said on the courthouse steps. He walked off without elaborating. DeGuerin cast doubt Monday on the validity of the Los Angeles arrest warrant that led to Durst's detention, and argued that items found in the hotel room search shouldn't be admissible because detectives may not have had a search warrant at the time. He also said a detective and prosecutor interrogated Durst for three hours without his attorney present. Since the weapons and drugs charges Durst faces in New Orleans are based on what investigators say they found in his hotel room, this is likely to come up again. But prosecutors argued that the matter at hand Monday was whether he is a flight risk or a danger to the community. The judge sided with the prosecution Monday. But this is just the first step in what will likely be a lengthy legal battle. \"As long as Louisiana wants us here, well, we'll stay here. We'll fight,\" DeGuerin said Monday. But the bigger courtroom fight will likely unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last week. Durst awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of \"lying in wait\" and killing Susan Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills, California, home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Robert Durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. \"I just don't think that they had sufficient evidence to have him arrested,\" DeGuerin said Monday. \"They had a lot of suspicion. They've always had a lot of suspicion. And that television show just added to that suspicion.\" It's not the first time Durst has been accused of murder. He admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor in a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. On Monday, police said there was a connection between Durst and a college student who disappeared from Vermont's Middlebury College in 1971. In response to a question at a Tuesday news conference from CNN, Middlebury Police Chief Tom Hanley said: \"There's nothing in the files to indicate (Durst) was questioned\" at the time of her disappearance. \"We don't know if they ever had any personal contact,\" the chief added. The connection in the case was one of proximity, Hanley said. Durst owned a health-food store in Middlebury, and Lynne Schulze was last seen across the street from the store near a bus stop. She had purchased dried prunes from the store earlier. DeGuerin brushed off the accusation, saying that his client \"may have been in Chicago when Jimmy Hoffa disappeared.\" Other cases in upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are also getting a new look. Durst was placed on suicide watch, according to police, but DeGuerin said last week that Durst needed to be in a hospital setting, not because of the possibility of suicide, but because he has serious medical conditions. The 71-year-old is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said last week. \"At the same time he was in the hospital he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,\" DeGuerin said. Durst appeared in court Monday with his head shaved, the stent prominent. DeGuerin also said that Durst is \"mildly autistic\" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism. \"He's quiet and he's reserved and he's actually bashful. But he's always been looked upon as a little bit odd,\" DeGuerin said. \"And what we discovered 15 years ago was that he's autistic, mildly autistic, but it explains a lot of his, what others look upon as unusual or bizarre behavior.\" But DeGuerin said his client's health struggles don't mean he's incompetent to stand trial. And DeGuerin said they're eager to go to court and fight the accusations against him. \"He's a little frail and he has some memory problems sometimes,\" DeGuerin said. \"But he's not incompetent.\" CNN's Anne Woolsey, Amanda Watts, Jean Casarez and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.\n",

But she was unprepared for the adulation she received while filming a biopic about Mother Teresa in the slums of India. As she passed through the slums, locals dropped to the ground believing the Nobel Peace Prize winner had been brought back to life to care for the poor. Scroll down for video . Juliet Stevenson was treated like a saint while filming a biopic on the Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa . Stevenson, who is not a Christian, was wary of taking on the role but said it had been a 'wonderful challenge' Stevenson told The Observer: 'I was filming in her iconic white sari with the blue stripes. 'People would come up to me, drop and touch my hem...in India, she's still revered. She lifted tens of thousands of people off the streets and into her care.' Stevenson, who starred in films such as Truly, Madly, Deeply, The Politician's Wife and Accused, is heading the cast of the forthcoming feature film about Mother Teresa, The Letters. The biopic explores the life of the saint through letters she wrote to her longtime friend and spiritual advisor,\u00a0Father Celeste van Exem over a nearly 50-year period. The letters, published in 2007, revealed her crisis of faith and the torment of feeling Jesus had abandoned her. Mother Teresa, who died in 1997 aged 87, became one of the 20th century's most influential religious figures. She founded an international order - the Missionaries of Charity - in the slums of Calcutta dedicated to the poor, disabled and dying. She won the Noble Peace Prize in 1979 for her role in founding the order and by the time of her death, it had grown to more than 4,000 sisters running orphanages, hospices and charity centres in 133 countries. The film partly draws on Mother Teresa's secret letters, published in 2007 revealing her crisis of faith . The biopic will be released this year in the hope it coincides with Mother Teresa's canonisation . Stevenson, who is not religious, was initially wary of taking on the role but said it had been a 'wonderful challenge'. To perfect the role, Stevenson watched and listened 'endlessly' to historic recordings of Mother Teresa. She told The Observer: 'It was very daunting, because I'm so wrong for her. I'm 5ft 8in, quite strongly built. I'm not in any way miniature (Mother Teresa was only 5ft). 'I don't have a religious faith and she believed so ardently in God. I also couldn't differ from her more when it comes to her views on women's rights, birth control and abortion...but it was a wonderful challenge.' There was an early screening of The Letters at the Vatican, at the International Catholic film festival last year. Its cast also includes 85-year-old Swedish actor Max von Sydow and Rutger Hauer, who won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor in Escape from Sobibor. It is directed by William Riead who was inspired by Richard Attenborough's Oscar-winning film Gandhi. The biopic will be released this year in the hope it coincides with Mother Teresa's canonisation.\n",

        "input": "The striking sight of a solar eclipse will capture the attention of commuters across Britain on their way to work this Friday. It will be the first time that the astronomical spectacle has occurred during rush-hour in the UK, and there are fears that motorists may take their eyes off the wheel to watch the cosmic alignment. Experts have warned that drivers may be dazzled as they watch the sun or risk a crash simply by letting their concentration falter. The path of totality for Friday's eclipse will travel from just beneath the Greenland peninsula to the Arctic Circle. The left-hand animation shows the totality of the 1999 eclipse. The right-hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 March will travel over Europe . On 20 March, the moon's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over Earth. The proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near-total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the UK, so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in London, Manchester will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The most \u2018complete\u2019 eclipse in the UK will be see from Lerwick in the Shetland Isles. Timeings will vary, so that in London, the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun's edge - will begin at 8.24am. The eclipse will peak at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. By 10.41am, the moon will leave the sun's edge and the partial eclipse will end. The solar eclipse is set to block out nearly 90 per cent of sunlight across parts of Europe. On the morning of the 20 March the moon's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun casting a shadow over Earth - and the eclipse will be the biggest event of its kind since 11 August 1999 (pictured over Germany) The eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in London and around 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. A partial eclipse will be visible across Europe, North Africa and Russia for about 90 minutes. Driving experts have warned drivers to keep their eyes' on the road to avoid accidents . The last solar eclipse of a similar size took place on 11 August 1999 and had an eclipse magnitude of 1.029. An eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the sun\u2019s diameter obscured by the moon. It is based on a ratio of diameters and differs from an eclipse obscuration, which is a measure of the sun\u2019s surface area covered by the moon. The value given is taken at the moment when the eclipse is at is maximum. The maximum of two minutes and 23 seconds of totality for the 1999 eclipse occurred close to Ramnicu Valcea in Romania. It was said to have been the first total eclipse visible in Europe since 22 July 1990, and the first visible in the UK since 29 June 1927. For spectators in Edinburgh, for example, the eclipse will begin, peak and end four minutes later. Skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent, which includes north-western Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetland Islands, meaning that drivers in these places will have to switch on their headlights. But RAC spokesman Simon Williams told MailOnline: \u2018The biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist\u2019s perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness.' He said that distraction is a major cause of accidents on the road and was a contributory factor in 23 per cent of fatal accidents in 2013. \u2018It is imperative that rush-hour drivers maintain good focus on the road ahead rather than being tempted to catch a glimpse of the moon obscuring the sun and therefore not fully concentrating on what\u2019s going on around them,' he added. \u2018Anyone that does, is not only taking their eyes off the road, but may well end up being temporarily blinded from the sun\u2019s brightness before it is eclipsed. \u2018The weather will also play an important role on the day: if it is a bright day, the eclipse will be more dramatic and may therefore pose a greater distraction to motorists. \u2018The best advice has to be to either watch the eclipse from a safe place or watch it on the news later as the risk of doing it from the wheel could result in you becoming part of a nasty news story.\u2019 The Highways Agency has advised road users to drive carefully and adjust their speed, just as they would for unusual weather or road conditions. An RAC spokesman told MailOnline: \u2018The biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist\u2019s perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness. Distraction is a major cause of accidents (stock image) on the road and was, in fact, a contributory factor in 23 per cent of fatal accidents in 2013.' Projection:\u00a0Place a pinhole or small opening in a card, and hold it between the sun and a screen \u2013 giant sheet of white paper works \u2013 a few feet away. Filters: The sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose. Such filters have a thin layer of aluminum, chromium or silver on the surfaces. Telescopes with solar filters: There are sun-specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse. Referring to the rush hour problem, Robin Scagell, vice president of the Society for Popular Astronomy (SPA) told The Independent: \u2018It\u2019s not the best time [for an eclipse] from a safety point of view.\u2019 However, he told MailOnline: 'Practically speaking there shouldn't be a problem - even from the north of Scotland there will still be plenty of light and if you didn't know there was an eclipse in progress you might not even notice. 'It will still be broad daylight and no darker than if there were some cloud in front of the sun. But danger could occur if a driver decides to take a quick look at the sun. He said: 'There are the obvious issues about being distracted while driving, whether it's looking at the sun or anything else that attracts your attention away from the road. 'But if you stare at the bright sun you could be dazzled, which could then affect your ability to spot something in your way if not leading to permanent eye damage.' He said that while drivers often have to cope with driving in a low sun, they\u00a0typically\u00a0concentrate on the road, but 'reflex action prevents you from actually staring at it, and moves your centre of attention around.' 'If you want to view the eclipse stop somewhere safe and make sure you have eclipse glasses with you. Sunglasses are no good - not even several pairs on top of each other,' he said. Institutions such as SPA and the Royal Astronomical society have called on people to watch the event safely, using special glasses or pinhole cameras, for example and have published tips and guidelines. The solar eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered over London and around 94 per cent in the main cities in Scotland (pictured is a full eclipse over Australia in 2012)\u00a0The Highways Agency has advised road users to drive carefully and adjust their speed, just as they would for unusual weather or road conditions . Tom Kerss, astronomer at The Royal Observatory Greenwich said: 'Since the Moon is smaller than the Earth, and very far away, the properly dark shadow it casts will only be about 100 miles wide, and will spend most of its time darkening the chilly waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. 'However, if the weather is clear, observers on Svalbard and the Faroes should experience almost three minutes of extraordinary day-time darkness. 'What\u2019s more, lunar perigee - the time in the Lunar month when the Earth and Moon are closest together - will occur the evening before the eclipse. This makes our 2015 Spring Equinox eclipse a \u2018supermoon\u2019 eclipse - perhaps we should call that a supereclipse. 'Since the shadow of the moon will be ever so slightly larger in this scenario, it might appear slightly darker during totality, but in practise I think this would be difficult to detect, even by an experienced eclipse chaser. 'Nevertheless, it\u2019s nice to have a supermoon, equinox and eclipse all falling on the same day. 'It\u2019ll be well worth taking a look outside to see the two most important astronomical bodies in our lives rising together, and witness the last eclipse to cover so much of the sun from Europe in over a decade.' The eclipse could disrupt solar power supplies across Europe, energy experts have warned. The spread of huge solar arrays across the EU means that more than 10 per cent of the continent\u2019s electricity now comes from solar panels. With power supply so reliant on the sun\u2019s rays, the solar eclipse on 20 March might lead to blackouts. Electricity system operators have warned that the eclipse poses \u2018an unprecedented test for Europe\u2019s electricity system\u2019. The European Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity, a group of power supply organisations, said: \u2018The risk of incident cannot be completely ruled out. \u2018Solar eclipses have happened before but with the increase of installed photovoltaic energy generation, the risk of an incident could be serious without appropriate countermeasures.\u2019 The organisation said it had been planning so-called \u2018countermeasures\u2019 for months, with suppliers across Europe set to help balance the load with more energy from other power stations as solar electricity drops off. The eclipse is not expected to cause blackouts in Britain because so little of our power comes from solar power. Despite a boom in British solar arrays in recent years, particularly in southern England, solar power today provides just 1.5 per cent of our electricity needs. The National Grid said it expected solar power output in Britain to halve from an average March figure of 3,000 megawatts to 1,700 megawatts.\n",

He was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and remained in intensive care for almost a week - but despite the best efforts of doctors he died today. South Wales Police say they have now launched a murder inquiry. The teenager and two friends went to a number of pubs in the Porthcawl area before they returned to the park at 1am. Connor was found seven hours later by early morning campers. Police made a caravan to caravan search at the park - one of the biggest in the UK and a favourite for families. Holidaymaker father-of-three Martin Hatley, from Swindon, said: 'I was shocked. As a dad to a teenage boy myself it's terrible to hear about something like this. Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley said: 'Officers are continuing to conduct inquiries to establish the full circumstances of what happened. 'However, we would appeal to anyone who has any information that could assist us with our inquiries to contact us immediately. 'This was a brutal attack upon Connor with fatal consequences. 'I believe the person responsible may have shared information with friends, relatives or neighbours and I would urge anyone who has information or who may have been in the area of Trecco Bay between midnight and 7am on March 8 to contact the police. Connor Marshall was found unconscious at Trecco Bay Caravan Park, Porthcawl, on Sunday morning . Connor (pictured) and two friends went to a number of pubs in the Porthcawl area before they returned to the park at 1am. Connor was found unconscious seven hours later by people in the caravan park . 'I would like to reassure residents and visitors to Porthcawl and Trecco Bay caravan park that this appears to be an isolated incident on a well-managed site. 'Parkdean Trecco Bay Management are continuing to work closely with South Wales Police. 'Our thoughts are with Connor's family and all those affected by this tragic incident.' Earlier in the week, forensic specialists were seen searching for clues in the Sycamore Drive and Cedars area of Trecco Bay - one of the UK's biggest caravan parks. A caravan park spokesman said their thoughts were with Connor's family and that they are doing all they can to help the police with their investigation. Anyone able to help police with their inquiries should contact 01656 655555, 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111, quoting the reference number 1500080214. South Wales Police announced they were launching a murder investigation after Connor died today .\n",

        "input": "Eating too much salt may be bad for your heart \u2013 but it can protect against skin infections, research has found. A high-salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin, boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections, say scientists. In an experiment, German researchers discovered that mice which were fed a high-salt diet healed infections in their feet more quickly. Too much salt may be bad for your heart but it can protect against skin infections, new research found . This is because the salt had raised the activity of immune cells called macrophages, making their immune systems more responsive. The findings, published in the journal Cell Metabolism, may also highlight how salt was once effectively used to ward off infections before antibiotics were invented. Professor Jonathan Jantsch, of the University of Regensburg, said: 'Up to now, salt has been regarded as a detrimental dietary factor; it is clearly known to be detrimental for cardiovascular diseases, and recent studies have implicated a role in worsening autoimmune diseases. 'Our current study challenges this one-sided view and suggests that increasing salt accumulation at the site of infections might be an ancient strategy to ward off infections, long before antibiotics were invented.' High levels of sodium stored in the skin, especially in the elderly, can lead to high blood pressure and increase the risk for heart disease and stroke, worsen autoimmune disease and even increase the risk of stomach cancer. Professor Jens Titze from Vanderbilt University added: 'Despite the overwhelming evidence linking dietary salt to disease in humans, the potential evolutionary advantage of storing so much salt in the body has not been clear.' A high-salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin, boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections, say scientists . The researchers found that infected areas in patients with bacterial skin infections also showed remarkably high salt accumulation. But in experiments high salt diet mice had increased immunity against microbial infections by boosting the activity of immune cells called macrophages. This meant that mice who had infections in their feet caused by a parasite called Leishmania major were able to heal more quickly. Future studies will examine how salt accumulates in the skin and triggers immune responses, and why salt accumulates in the skin of ageing adults. Professor Jantsch went on: 'A further understanding of the regulatory cascades might not only help to design drugs that specifically enhance local salt deposition and help to combat infectious diseases, but also may lead to novel strategies to mobilise sodium stores in the ageing population and prevent cardiovascular disease. 'We also think that local application of high-salt-containing wound dressings and the development of other salt-boosting antimicrobial therapies might bear therapeutic potential.' But he warned everyone should not rush off and start a high salt diet. He added: 'Due to the overwhelming clinical studies demonstrating that high dietary salt is detrimental to hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, we feel that at present our data does not justify recommendations on high dietary salt in the general population. 'Nevertheless, in situations where endogenous accumulation of salt to sites of infection is insufficient, supplementation of salt might be a therapeutic option. 'But this needs to be addressed in further studies.'\n",

        "input": "A severe solar storm has smacked Earth with a surprisingly big geomagnetic jolt, potentially affecting power grids and GPS tracking while pushing the colorful northern lights farther south, federal forecasters said. So far no damage has been reported. Two blasts of magnetic plasma left the sun on Sunday, combined and arrived on Earth about 15 hours earlier and much stronger than expected, said Thomas Berger, director of the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. Scroll down for video . Where the Aurora could be seen: Forecasters said early Tuesday, before sunrise, auroras were already seen in the northern tier of the U.S., such as Washington state, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Aurora Borealis or northern lights that usually can be viewed only in the far north will dip south as a result of the storm, so more people should be able to enjoy the colorful sky show. Forecasters were not sure just how far south it would be visible. Forecasters said early Tuesday, before sunrise, auroras were already seen in the northern tier of the U.S., such as Washington state, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. They said there is 'very strong possibility' that the northern lights could be seen as far south as the middle United States, even Tennessee and Oklahoma . This storm ranks a 4, called severe, on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 1-to-5 scale for geomagnetic effects. It is the strongest solar storm to blast Earth since the fall of 2013. It's been nearly a decade since a level 5 storm, termed extreme, has hit Earth. Forecasters figured it would come late Tuesday night into Wednesday morning; instead, it arrived just before 10 a.m. EDT. They had forecast it to be a level 1. 'It's significantly stronger than expected,' Berger said. Forecasters had predicted a glancing blow instead of dead-on hit. Another theory is that the combination of the two storms made it worse, but it's too early to tell if that's so, he said. The storm seemed to be weakening slightly, but that may not continue, and it could last all day, officials said. It has the potential to disrupt power grids but only temporarily. It also could cause degradation of the global positioning system, so tracking maps and locators may not be as precise as normal. Often these types of storms come with bursts of radiation that can affect satellite operations, but this one has not, Berger said. But the most noticeable effect is usually considered a positive. The Aurora Borealis or northern lights that usually can be viewed only in the far north will dip south, so more people should be able to enjoy the colorful sky show.

Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. Forecasters said early Tuesday, before sunrise, auroras were already seen in the northern tier of the U.S., such as Washington state, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Space Weather branch chief Brent Gordon said if the storm effects continued through Tuesday evening, there was a 'very strong possibility' that the northern lights could be seen as far south as the middle United States, even Tennessee and Oklahoma. That also means much of Russia and northern Europe, as far south as central Germany and Poland, had the potential for the sky show. The sky has to be clear of clouds but the crescent moon will appear small enough it shouldn't interfere with viewing of the aurora is in the sky, Gordon said.

Liverpool\u2019s influential captain is fit again after recovering from a hamstring problem he sustained on February 10 but there is no guarantee that Rodgers will put him straight back into the starting line-up, as would have been the case during the majority of his career at Anfield. During Gerrard\u2019s absence, Liverpool won three consecutive Barclays Premier League games against Southampton, Manchester City and Burnley but Rodgers feels that sequence is going to have to continue in what will be a pivotal week for the club, with tonight\u2019s trip to Swansea followed by next Sunday\u2019s showdown with Manchester United.

Sam Mullet Sr and 15 others were convicted three years ago of restraining and forcibly disfiguring Amish people with whom they disagreed in a bid to destroy an important symbol of their beliefs. But after an appeals court dismissed hate crimes convictions against them last year, eight of them were resentenced on their remaining charges - mainly, conspiracy to obstruct justice - on Monday. Mullet, who originally received a 15-year sentence, was ordered to serve 10 years, nine months, in prison. Meanwhile, sentences for four other men who received seven years were cut to five years. Scroll down for video . Court hearing: A rogue Amish sect leader and seven of his followers who were jailed for brutally chopping off the hair and beards of rivals in their eastern Ohio community have had their sentences reduced following an appeal. Above, members of the Bergholz community are seen leaving federal court in Cleveland on Monday . Leaving court: Sam Mullet Sr and 15 others were convicted three years ago of restraining and forcibly disfiguring Amish people with whom they disagreed. Eight of them were resentenced on their remaining charges - mainly, conspiracy to obstruct justice - on Monday. Abov, more Amish people leave the courthouse . Leader: Mullet (pictured, left, in his police mug shot, and right, standing in the front yard of his home in Bergholz in 2011), who originally received a 15-year sentence, was resentenced to 10 years and nine months in prison . And the sentences for three men who\u00a0initially\u00a0got five years were lowered to three years, seven months. The other eight convicts, including six women, have already served their sentences. None of the 16 defendants spoke in court. Hair and beards have spiritual significance in the Amish faith. Amish men do not shave their beards after marriage, believing it shows their devotion to God. During the 2011 attacks, some of the victims were awakened in the middle of the night by members of the Bergholz-based breakaway Amish group, before being restrained and viciously disfigured. At an earlier court hearing, a sheriff testified that one bishop's hair was unevenly chopped to the scalp by Mullet's followers, leaving his skin bloody. Another victim claimed four or five men dragged him out of his house by his chest-length beard and chopped it to within 1 1/2 inches of his chin. Prosecutors argued the original sentences should have remained intact because of the defendants' religious motivation and the fact that the sentences were lower than what federal guidelines allowed. However, attorneys for all the imprisoned men asked Judge Dan Aaron Polster at the court in Cleveland on Monday to reduce their clients' sentences to time served, allowing for their release. Protest: Sentences for four other men who received seven years were cut to five years. Above, Werner Lange holds a sign reading, 'FREE THE AMISH', as he stands outside the federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, on Monday . Met by the press: The sentences for three men who initially got five years were lowered to three years and seven months. The other eight convicts, including six women, have already served their sentences . Shocking assaults: During the 2011 attacks, some of the victims were awakened in the middle of the night by members of the Bergholz-based breakaway Amish group, before being restrained and viciously disfigured . Edward Bryan, one of Mullet's attorneys, told the court it would be an 'irrational fear' to think his client - who was accused of ruling his followers with an iron fist - would commit another crime. The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals dismissed the hate crime convictions because of improper jury instructions by Polster on whether the 16 attacked their victims because of their religion. However, on Monday, Judge Polster made it clear that he remains convinced the hair and beard-cutting assaults were 'substantially motivated by the victims' religion.' He said the defendants inflicted trauma on the victims and trampled on their First Amendment right of religious freedom. 'The remaining eight defendants still warrant substantial sentences,' he said. Religious: At an earlier court hearing, a sheriff testified that one bishop's hair was unevenly chopped to the scalp by Mullet's followers, leaving his skin bloody. Above, five Amish men at the courthouse three years ago . Sons: Mullet's sons Johnny (left) and Lester (right) were among those charged in the 'beard-cutting' attacks . Although Mullet did not participate in any of the attacks, assistant U.S. attorney Bridget Brennan said in court that he exerted tight control as bishop and leader of the sect. She said that he encouraged the assaults, each of which began and ended at Mullet's home. 'These were orchestrated, terrorizing attacks,' Ms Brennan said. Mr Bryan tried to evoke sympathy for Samuel Mullet by pointing out that his wife of nearly 40 years died in November and that some members of the sect, situated near the panhandle of West Virginia, have left the group, including a co-defendant whose husband was resentenced on Monday. 'No one is trying to minimize what happened,' Mr Bryan said. 'It was wrong. My client knows that.' 'Tight control': Mullet (pictured) did not participate in any of the attacks, but assistant U.S. attorney Bridget Brennan said in court he exerted tight control as bishop and leader of the sect, and encouraged the attacks . The community has been shunned since the attacks by other Amish communities and hasn't been able to find another Amish bishop willing to perform marriages and funerals, the defense said. 'A stigma will forever be attached to this community,' Mullet's attorneys said. Ohio has an Amish population of around 61,000 - second only to Pennsylvania - with most living in rural counties south and east of Cleveland. They have a modest lifestyle and are deeply religious. Their traditions of traveling by horse and buggy and forgoing most modern conveniences distance themselves from the outside world and symbolize a yielding to a collective order.\n",

        "input": "Harry Arter scored his second wonder goal in five days as Bournemouth stepped up their bid to reach the Barclays Premier League with an emphatic 3-0 win over Middlesbrough. Arter's powerful 20-yard strike early in the second half was sandwiched between penalties from Yann Kermorgant and substitute Brett Pitman as Bournemouth leapfrogged Middlesbrough in the Sky Bet Championship table to assert their claim for automatic promotion. Newly called up by the Republic of Ireland, Arter also showed his quality with a stunning goal in Tuesday's 1-1 draw at Cardiff. Harry Arter celebrates his brilliant strike that gave Bournemouth their second goal against Middlesbrough . The Cherries were on the front foot for the majority of the tussle against a team that began the day in second place, and Kermorgant could have put Eddie Howe's men in front in the second minute. Middlesbrough goalkeeper Dimi Konstantopoulos made a good save low to his left to deny the French striker. Callum Wilson's pace created problems for the visitors' defence all afternoon and it was Bournemouth's leading scorer who won the first penalty, as he was bundled over by Tomas Kalas. Kermorgant stepped up and coolly drove the 12th-minute spot-kick into the right corner of the net. The first half was played at a frenetic pace and Bournemouth could have been further ahead at the interval. Yann Kermorgant places a penalty during the first half to set Bournemouth on their way to victory . Matt Ritchie had a drilled effort blocked by the back of George Friend in the 26th minute, before Kermorgant's well-struck volley was saved by Konstantopoulos. Ritchie forced the Middlesbrough goalkeeper back into action again in the 31st minute, but his left-footed effort was easily held. Middlesbrough were unable to truly test Artur Boruc in the first 45 minutes. Their best chance came on the half hour when Adam Reach flicked Patrick Bamford's cross into the hands of the Poland goalkeeper. Bournemouth came out after the break with the same attacking intentions as the first, with Tommy Elphick having a close-range header saved almost immediately after the restart. Arter doubled the Cherries' lead in the 48th minute, with his fine curling left-footed effort going in off the inside of the left post. Brett Pitman celebrates after netting a penalty for Bournemouth's third goal in the win over Middlesbrough . Bamford felt he should have had a penalty in the 58th minute after being pulled in the box by Steve Cook, but referee Anthony Taylor disagreed. Middlesbrough thought they had got a goal back in the 68th minute, but Bamford's header was disallowed as he came from an offside position. Bournemouth won their second penalty of the game in the 74th minute as the lively Arter surged forward into the Middlesbrough box before being pushed in the back by Albert Adomah. Pitman fired past Konstantopoulos to make it 3-0 and seal a priceless win. Bamford had the chance to get a consolation goal for Middlesbrough with four minutes to go, but his free-kick went just over the bar.\n",
        "output": "Bournemouth overtook Middlesbrough with a 2-0 win at Dean Court . The three points moved the Cherries top of the Championship . Yann Kermorgant opened scoring from the penalty spot after 12 minutes . Harry Arter's left-foot drive sealed the points three minutes after half-time . Brett Pitman then added a third with another penalty in the 74th minute .\n"

Incredible footage shows the terrifying moment Christopher Jones, 22, had an epileptic seizure while free-falling at 2743 m (9000 ft). Mr Jones, from Perth, suffered the near-death experience while trying to do a left-hand turn in mid-air and was saved by his fast-acting sky diving instructor who opened his parachute with seconds to spare. Christopher Jones - with his parents Mike and Lia Jones - suffered an epileptic seizure while skydiving . Skydiving instructor Sheldon McFarlane's quick action to release Mr Jones' parachute saved his life . Skydiving instructor Sheldon McFarlane, 40, said Mr Jones had epilepsy but hadn't had a seizure in four years and had been given the all-clear by his doctor. 'He had all the documentation and had been to his doctor, he had been seizure-free for a number of years and believed he had it under control,' Mr McFarlane told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Jones said he dreamed of being a pilot but was unable to because of his condition, so he had decided to try skydiving instead. 'I'd been seizure-free for four years,' he told ABC. 'I've always wanted to have the feeling of flight, so I just thought, considering I can't fly a plane due to my condition, I thought I'd give it a go.' Footage filmed from Mr McFarlane's helmet camera shows Mr Jones quickly lose consciousness after jumping out of a plane over Pinjarra, south of Perth, last November. The terrifying moment a skydiving student has a seizure while free-falling at 2743 m (9000 ft) Mr Jones suffered the near death experience while trying to do a left-hand turn . The 22-year-old was completing stage five of his Accelerated Free Fall program with an instructo . He can be seen flipping over and convulsing as he plummets 1524 m (5000 ft) towards the earth in 30 seconds. Mr McFarlane said he could see Mr Jones was spinning out of control but he did not realise he was having a seizure. 'He rolled over and was unconscious on his back and he started spinning,' he said. 'I thought he was having sensory overload or something, I wasn't quite sure what was going on. 'He was in the foetal positon.' Mr McFarlane said it was a tricky manoeuvre to get to Mr Jones and open his parachute, but said he was well-trained and had more than 20 years' experience as an instructor. Mr Jones pictured before jumping out of the light plane that was flying at 3658 m (12,000 ft) He quickly\u00a0lost consciousness and can be seen convulsing as he plummets 1524 m in 30 seconds . 'I thought it would be better to go down and make him stop,' he said. 'I just wanted to make sure he was safe and his parachute was open sooner rather than later.' Mr Jones regained consciousness at 914 m (3000 ft) and managed to land safely on the ground. He was completing stage five of his Accelerated Free Fall program with an instructor at the WA Skydiving Academy in Jandakot, southern Perth. Mr McFarlane only found out Mr Jones had suffered a seizure once the ground, after Mr Jones entered the hangar and told him.

In the recent case of a dolphin calf rescued off the eastern coast of Florida, about two days of effort involving seven boats and 35 people from 12 institutions and organizations. And that was after four weeks spent finding him and evaluating his situation to see whether it warranted intervention. With spring approaching, marine experts say it's a good reminder to look after your belongings when you take to the water. From plastic bags to swimming trunks to crab pots, marine life can get entangled in all manner of human debris. With limited time and resources, experts can't save them all. \"You really want to make sure you keep all your hands on your stuff,\" said Elizabeth Stratton, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries' assistant marine mammal stranding coordinator for the southeast region. \"We feel a special responsibility in cases where an animal's health is in danger because of debris introduced by humans,\" said Stratton, who was involved in last week's rescue. So where does an intervention begin? A couple spotted the calf off the coast of Fort Pierce with monofilament line wrapped around his rostrum, or snout. The mammal was riding the wake of their boat. They reported it January 18 to the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, which set out to find the calf and his mother. The group found the pair and took more pictures, which were sent to the NOAA Fisheries on February 9 for evaluation. The photos revealed monofilament line wrapped around the calf's upper jaw, cutting into the tissue to the bone, threatening his ability to eat or possibly leading to infection. Veterinarians who reviewed the photos deemed the injuries potentially life-threatening. \"We can't disentangle every animal,\" Stratton said, \"but If it comes back as life-threatening, we mobilize to do disentanglement.\" The next step was to find the creatures again. Through characteristics on the mother's dorsal fin, the group was able to identify her through records on file and target her home range for a search. After a two-day search, the group found the dolphins on Friday and approached for intervention. The process took about an hour, from netting the calf and his mother to sending them on their way, Stratton said. Apart from the fishing line both mother and son were in good condition. Rescuers gave the calf a long-lasting antibiotic and radio-tagged the mother before releasing them to the ocean \"where they belong,\" Stratton said. The moral of the story for humans: \"Be conscious of your gear.\" To report an injured marine mammal, call 877-WHALEHELP (877-942-5343).\n",

        "input": "(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent speech to the U.S. Congress has received disproportionate media attention across the world: the leader of America's most important client state in the Middle East defies the reservations of the White House, abusing Congress as a platform for his Israeli election campaign. Disregarding Israel's already strained bilateral relations with the United States, Netanyahu readily risked the consequences of humiliating the Obama administration in exchange for less than an hour of political self-manifestation -- typical for a man who is domestically known to be not much of a statesman. Netanyahu is a charismatic speaker and a passionate Israel-advocate, however, his personal and political interests have always taken precedence over serving Israel's national interests. Political survival has been the maxim of his domestic and foreign policies. Netanyahu joins a long list of Israeli politicians overwhelmed by the plurality and polarization of domestic public opinion. So far he has been just another Israeli leader seeking \"easy\" short-term answers to fundamentally strategic problems, thereby further protracting an already protracted conflict. As a puppet of ideological, conservative playmakers who whole-heartedly reject a two-state solution, Netanyahu has been held hostage by the likes of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Economy Minister Naftali Bennett who pursue a discriminatory policy of sectarian segregation intending to contain Palestinian public dissidence through mere coercion. Consequently, Netanyahu's foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the peace process has been a disaster. He took over from Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni -- two politicians who at least believed in a two-state solution and were ready to make sacrifices to keep the peace process alive. Israeli leaders typically fall into two categories: those who believe in peace and those that have the power to make peace. Olmert was the former, and Netanyahu long seemed like he could become the latter. In reality, however, Netanyahu is neither. He has given in to a toxic form of Jewish nationalism, disregarded Israel's relatively good regional position vis-\u00e0-vis its otherwise-occupied Arab neighbors; he has continued to build settlements out of spite, thought of ever new preconditions for bilateral negotiations with the Palestinians and waged a ruthless war against Gaza without a clear strategic endgame -- a war that was lost militarily and in terms of international reputation. Apart from the tragic effects of Netanyahu's policy on the peace process, his stubbornness has alienated allies in Europe and Washington. While the Arab world has been widely apathetic about the Israel-Palestinian issue amid regional disintegration, partners on both sides of the Atlantic have tried to facilitate the revitalization of constructive peace talks. Yet, Netanyahu chose to ignore external initiatives, retracting to a Jewish nationalist rhetoric founded on security paranoia, self-victimization and the illusion of Israeli autarky in security and defense. As a consequence, Israel's foreign relations with its most important strategic partners have noticeably cooled. Obama's Middle Eastern focus has shifted from the Israel/Palestinian issue to a rapprochement with Iran. European lawmakers are considering recognizing Palestinian statehood despite Israeli objections. More importantly, many traditionally pro-Israel Western publics have turned their back on the Jewish state. Younger generations in particular refuse to accept the narrative that shaped their parental generation: Israel as the David in a fight against Goliath. Israel's monopoly on victimhood has been undermined by an inflexible, uncompromising short-minded policy towards a Palestinian people under occupation whose narrative of victimhood increasingly finds attentive ears in the West. At first sight, then, the prospect of four more years of Netanyahu, does not sound too promising -- at least in regards to the peace process. At a closer look, however, a continuation of Netanyahu's policies might actually help the Palestinian cause. His implicit rejection of the two-state solution; his prioritization of short-term security over sustainable security solutions; his pursuit of a toxic Jewish nationalist agenda justifying an intensification of sectarianism between Israel and the Occupied Territories as well as within Israel, are all factors that will leave Israel increasingly isolated. His Israel-first narrative might win Netanyahu votes within a highly polarized electorate that in recent years has become more and more right-wing amid a top-down constructed climate of fear. Hamas' and Hezbollah's mid-tech missile capability, Syria's socio-political disintegration and subsequent rise of Islamist non-state actors, have been used by the Netanyahu government to create an Arab bogyman ostensibly threatening the Jewish state's very existence -- a new bogyman coexisting side-by-side with Netanyahu's \"favorite\" bogeyman, Iran. Despite Netanyahu's pre-occupation with security, the derailment of the peace process has not been much of a topic during the campaign so far. If Netanyahu receives another mandate on Tuesday, Israel will be further driven into the international offside, pressure from the West will increase and thereby the Palestinian cause will receive ever more attention and support from policymakers and publics across the world. Netanyahu has become somewhat of a villain in the West -- an untrustworthy, short-sighted politician who in comparison to his counterparts in Ramallah appears to lack the willingness to compromise, cooperate and empathize. Thus, while another term of Bibi will not be in the national interest of Israel, it will very likely serve the Palestinian interests.\n",
        "output": "Political survival has been maxim of Netanyahu's domestic and foreign policies, says Andreas Krieg . Krieg: Netanyahu's foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the peace process has been disaster . New term for Netanyahu will not be in national interest of Israel, it will serve Palestinian interests, Krieg adds .\n"

On Wednesday, lawmakers in Ireland rushed to close a loophole that temporarily made it legal to possess Ecstasy, crystal methamphetamine, ketamine, magic mushrooms and a host of other recreational drugs. The loophole was inadvertently opened the day before, when an appeals court invalidated one section of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The court ruled that Irish governments had been unconstitutionally adding substances to Section 2 of the law for decades. \"We prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet,\" Minister for Health Leo Varadkar said in a written statement. \"The emergency legislation ... will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment.\" The emergency law moved through the Irish legislature and was signed by the President on Wednesday, meaning that the drugs would become illegal to possess again at midnight, a Department of Health spokeswoman told CNN. Varadkar said the temporarily legalized substances -- which include a wide array of synthetic or \"head shop\" drugs -- \"all have very significant health risks that outweigh any perceived recreational benefits,\" according to the Irish Times. The original schedule of substances listed in the 1977 law -- including cannabis, cocaine and heroin -- were untouched by the appeals court ruling and remained illegal. Varadkar also told the Irish Times that the court ruling could affect \"dozens\" of cases, although The Journal of Ireland said the court's decision will affect only cases now in the judicial process.\n",

Now, an interactive tool can analyse your most recent tweets and its creator claims it can reveal your personality, by looking at how you use words. Called Analyse Words, it generates a user\u2019s emotional style and says whether they are upbeat, worried, angry or depressed, as well as revealing someone\u2019s social and thinking styles. Try the interactive tool below . Use the interactive tool above to analyse your most recent tweets and reveal your personality . The tool is created by James Pennebaker, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who studies the link between language and personality. To get results, users simply have to enter their Twitter handle and press a button that says 'Analyse Tweets'. A results page is then generated that counts the number of recent words studied and lists the latest tweets. But most intriguingly it tells users how upbeat, worried, angry and depressed they are, in terms of percentages. Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet, whereas the tweets of people who are predominantly worried contain anxious words and nervous questions. The tool is created by James Pennebaker, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who studies the link between language and personality. These are the results for Barack Obama, which show he is very upbeat and quite analytical . By inputting a Twitter handle, such as a celebrity's a result page is generated that counts the number of recent words studied and lists the latest tweets. It can be used to show the difference between people's emotional, social and thinking styles. For example, President Obama (left) is upbeat, while Katy Perry (right) is depressed . Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet. Tweets by worried users are dominated by anxious words and nervous questions. Angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals. Depressed people make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says. Angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals and people who have a high depression score make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says. The tool also analyses a user's social style and says whether they are plugged in, personable, arrogant or spacy. 'Plugged in' tweeters are socially engaged and use social words as well as talking to specific friends, according to the tool. Personable people use positive emotional words, pose questions and reference others frequently, while those who are 'arrogant or distant' tend to be well-read with 'an arms-length approach to socialising'. 'You scored high in this category if you discuss actions instead of emotions, use big words and don\u2019t reference yourself much,' it says. Twitter users who score highly in being a 'spacy valley girl' are excitable and have a habit of tweeting LOLLLLLs, the tool says. It also analyses user's thinking styles and tells them to what extent their tweets show they are analytical, sensory or how they seem to live in the moment. Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet, whereas angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals, while depressed people make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says. Singer Katy Perry's results are shown, which says she is depressed . Dr Pennebacker has previously developed a computer program called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) which looks at the choice, frequency and coninput of words to gauge a person\u2019s psychological state, Maria Konnikova writes for the New Yorker. 'Since the creation of the LIWC, in 1993, studies utilising the program have suggested a close connection between our language, our state of mind, and our behaviour,\u2019 she writes. For example, one study showed that the words used on a date can predict people\u2019s desire to be with someone, or in another situation can indicate a person\u2019s importance at work or even their sex and mental state. The tool also analyses a user's social style and says whether they are plugged in, personable, arrogant, meaning distant, and or spacy. Kanye West's results are shown above, which show he is mostly personable . A study by psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania last month revealed that words used in social media profiles can help determine parts of the US that are more likely to have high numbers of deaths due to heart disease. Psychologist Johannes Eichstaedt led a team that analysed 826million tweets from 1,400 counties in the US for words associated with anger, anxiety and other emotions, to emotionally profile users. They found that counties where people\u2019s tweets included hostile, aggressive and lazy words, such as \u2018jealous\u2019 and \u2018bored\u2019 had higher rates of death from heart attacks and strokes, whereas places with more positive tweeters had less. This suggests that negative and angry language used on social media could be used to predict medical conditions, but the field of research is young.\n",

Scroll down for video . Khan's mother Zubaida Begum and his brother Syed Sarif Uddin Khan comfort each other after hearing of his death by lynch mob . Khan, 60, cannot accept her son is now dead after a mob broke into a prison and dragged him out to be beaten on the streets .

I want him back.\u2019 The widow and mother of seven can barely speak through the grief. Sharif\u2019s youngest brother, Syed Naseeruddin Khan, 28, said the family feels guilty for not being able to help him.

We\u2019re terrified of leaving the house in case the mob come for us too.\u2019 According to police Khan had been accused of raping a 19-year-old student on February 23 at a hotel in Dimapur, in the state of Nagaland, eastern India. A mass protest erupted against the rape charges on Thursday and an Indian mob broke into Dimapur Central Jail and managed to pull out Sharif before beating him on the streets. The mob stripped him naked and paraded him through the town before he was beaten to death and his body hung from a clock tower in the heart of Dimapur. They also set fire to homes and shops in an area where the suspect ran his business. Naseeruddin said they burnt many of the family\u2019s cars and properties. He explained: \u2018Our shop with seven cars in Dimapur was ruined, they were set on fire and looted. \u2018We were all terrified for our lives; we left the city as the protests started. We fled to our ancestral family home in Assam. We thought we were in danger too.\u2019 Several thousand people gathered as alleged rapist Syed Farid Khan (pictured, top) was mercilessly beaten to death by a lynch mob. Police have now arrested 18 people who were part of the frenzied mob . The gang overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man before beating him to death . Police say they are now verifying if the men arrests besides being part of the mob were also involved in the lynching . The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Khan had given her 5,000 ($80) rupees after the attack in return for her silence . Sharif married his wife Holy Begum, 27, ten years ago and they had two children, but their son died in 2009. They now have a three-year-old daughter Sneha. Naseeruddin said: \u2018We just can\u2019t believe our brother was a rapist. \u2018The girl told us that if we paid her 2 Lakh Rupees (\u00a32,000) she would withdraw the case. We are sure this was just an attempt to get money out of our family because we have done well for ourselves.\u2019 Naseeruddin, who has another brother serving in the Indian Army's Assam Regiment, said that he and his family left the city for fear of their lives but Sharif\u2019s wife Holy tried to save her husband as the mob beat him. He added: \u2018Holy is from Nagaland state so she felt safer and she could stay. She told us that when she heard about the mob she ran into town but the mob wouldn\u2019t let her pass, they stopped her from getting to him. \u2018We feel very bad that we could not help him. We could\u2019ve saved him if we had got to him. \u2018Sharif was a wonderful person, he loved his wife a lot and we cannot believe he would ever rape anyone. We demand justice for my brother. We demand a CBI enquiry into this case and we\u2019re hoping the Assam Government will support us. Protesters in Tinsukia demonstrate against the mob killing of a man accused of rape in neighbouring Nagaland state . 'If we do not get justice, my mother would die. She is unable to accept that he is no more.\u2019 The family is now waiting for Holy to arrive in their village with Sharif\u2019s body today. Meanwhile, Inspector General of Police Wabang Jamir confirmed: 'So far we have arrested 18 people for rioting and unlawful assembly.' 'We are now verifying if besides being part of the mob they were also directly involved in the lynching.' 'We have already identified many more people (for arrest) from videos and photos (of the incident on social media.' The lynching comes as India is in the midst of a raging controversy over a government order to ban the broadcast of a documentary about the December 2012 fatal gang-rape of a young student in New Delhi. Indian women protest for women's safety and equality, and call for severe punishment of men convicted of rape, on the eve of International Women's Day in Ahmedabad .

India has seen an outpouring of anger over frightening levels of violence against women since the 2012 attack, which sparked shock both within India and around the world. But the lynching is also linked to ethnic tensions within Nagaland, whose indigenous groups have for years accused growing numbers migrants from Bangladesh of illegally settling on their land and eating into resources.

Nathan Thompson allegedly loaded 11 bull terriers cross puppies into his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri on Wednesday, according to the Daily Telegraph. As a result of his plea, Thompson cannot own, acquire, buy or possess any animal, or even be around another animal without an adult present, for a decade. Scroll down for video . Nathan Thompson, 25, allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon.\u00a0Only one of the animals survived (pictured) Thompson (pictured) leaves\u00a0East Maitland Court after pleading guilty to animal abuse . Magistrate Caleb Franklin granted Thompson bail to be sentenced on April 28. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend. 'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said. But he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated. The 25-year-old allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Police say an advertisement on Gumtree was placed online last Thursday for the sale of 11 Bull Terrier cross puppies. Almost a week later, it is alleged the owner had not sold the dogs and offered the puppies free of charge to the 25-year-old who accepted. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock, then throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove from the area with five of the dogs still alive. The RSPCA were contacted and attended the location, before taking the attacked puppies to a vet. Only one of the animals, named Lucky, survived. David O'Shannessy, RSPCA NSW's chief inspector, told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked by the incident. 'We deal with a lot of cases but in this particular incident someone has allegedly gone out of their way to do something to the dogs which makes it even more concerning for us,' he said. 'This sort of situation doesn't have to occur.' Mr O'Shannessy says by the time the RSPCA arrived at the scene only two dogs were alive. Nathan Thompson, the man accused\u00a0of horrifically murdering 10 puppies, pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' he said. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' Police and RSPCA arrested the 25-year-old at a house in Kurri Kurri on Thursday. Police say the man allegedly told them four of the five remaining puppies were destroyed and the fifth was re-homed. 'Something's not quite right with the numbers so we've made some inquiries about the other dogs,' Mr\u00a0O'Shannessy said. Lucky, the surviving dog, is in the care of the RSCPA and is stable, however Mr\u00a0O'Shannessy says he has 'grave concerns' for her. 'She appeared to have some injuries and had blood shot eyes when we rescued her,' he said. 'But who knows what Lucky's witnessed.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",

        "input": "The chief White House spokesman denied having any knowledge of the criminal charges that are reportedly being brought against New Jersey lawmaker Bob Menendez on Monday and used the lack of awareness as proof positive that the alleged investigation is a form of political payback. 'I cant speak to the accuracy of those claims,' the president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said when asked about a news report claiming that federal prosecutors are preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against the Democratic senator. And just because its been reported in the press, well, 'that's not proof of them being a fact,' he said. 'I don't know if there's a Menendez investigation.' 'If there is a criminal investigation on the way, it is one that had been done wholly separate and apart from any sort of political interference,' he stated. THE SENATOR: Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption . POLITICS: (l-r) Menendez, donor Salomon Melgen, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and her husband Paul, posed in February 2012 at a National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials gala . CNN reported on Friday that a grand jury probe that has lasted two years was reaching a crescendo, and prosecutors, under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out, would soon bring charges against Menendez that stem from his relationship with Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, a wealthy and prolific donor. The senator's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on his friend's behalf, pushing back against accusations of overbilling the Medicare system by $8.9 million. Menendez has also repaid Melgen $58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor's private jet, mostly to the posh Dominican Republic resot Casa de Campo. The senator has fiercely denied he has done anything illegal, and one of his conservative colleagues in the Senate, Ted Cruz, has suggested the investigation is politically motivated. Menendez told reporters on Friday, I have 'always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law. 'I am not going anywhere,' he promised. Tricia Enright, Menendez's communications director, told Daily Mail Online in a statement that 'the facts will ultimately confirm' that his behavior was in no way improper. 'The Senator has counted Dr. Melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades,' Enright said. 'The two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other\u2019s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts.' She called the investigation's beginnings 'suspect,' referring to 'false allegations' that have been 'discredited' in the past. 'The timing seems awfully coincidental,' Cruz said of the probe on Saturday while speaking to reporters. 'The very week when Bob Menendez showed incredible courage to speak out and call out President Obama for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security,' is the same week reports that he'll be charged came out. That's 'troubling,' Cruz said. Menendez, 61, has seen pressure from the Obama administration over his positions on Cuba and Iran. Speaking to reporters on Saturday after an appearance at the Iowa Ag Summit, Cruz said the timing of the charges 'seems awfully coincidental.' COY: Asked Monday about the alleged probe, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said,\u00a0'I don't know if there's a Menendez investigation' The same week Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'came to Washington, spoke in Congress about the enormous threat of President Obama's misguided deal with Iran,' he said, and 'the very week when Bob Menendez showed incredible courage to speak out and call out President Obama for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security,' is the same week reports that he'll be charged came out. That's 'troubling,' the Texas lawmaker said. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham made a similar observation at Saturday's event, according to CNN. 'They leaked a story about an impending indictment right after the [American Israeli Public Affairs Committee] conference, right after Bob Menendez said, to his great credit, stood up and said I want to look at any deal you with Iran,' Graham charged. 'As to Bob Menendez, like every other American, he's innocent until proven otherwise. He's a friend. But this whole behavior around the Obama administration regarding the law is very disturbing.' Attorney General Eric Holder, according to the network, has already given his approval. But he insisted 'I can't comment on that' when a reporter asked him about the report Friday afternoon after Obama gave a speech in South Carolina. Asked Monday about the alleged investigation, Earnest said, 'We don't know whether or not they're true.' 'I'm not going to comment on them for that reason.' 'The other reason I'm loathe to comment on this is that there is a principle this administration takes very seriously,' and that is 'ensuring that prosecutions are kept separate and apart from political interference or even the appearance of political interference.' 'That undermines the claims of a lot of people, including apparently Sen. Cruz,' he stated. Menendez's first high-level meeting at HHS related to Melgen's Medicare troubles occurred on June 7, 2012, according to court documents seen by the\u00a0New Jersey Law Journal. The government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with Marilyn Tavenner, who was then in charge of the agency's Medicare and Medicaid subagency. Court papers also indicate Menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call, and then took Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, to an August 2, 2012 meeting with the Department of Health and Human Services's then-secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. CNN reported that Melgen was one of the Medicare system's most-reimbursed doctors nationwide, during the years when he was also a major donor to Menendez and to the Majority PAC. That political action committee, run by former Reid staffers, collected more than $700,000 from Melgen and made sure $600,000 of it benefited Menendez\u2019s re-election campaign. Meanwhile, the conservative activist group American Commitment has called on Menendez to resign his office. On a new website called ByeBob.com, the group claims he 'unethically, and likely criminally, compromised his ability to represent the people of New Jersey.' The senator, now the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman until two months ago, has become a thorn in the White House's side by taking positions that grate on President Obama. Menendez opposed the president's rapprochement with Cuban strongman Raul Castro, saying in December that his actions 'have vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.' He has stood in the way of the State Department's negotiations with Iran, threatening to lead Congress in imposing new sanctions on the Islamic Republic if it doesn't shelve its nuclear ambitions. The White House has insisted the Iranians can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain. 'I have to be honest with you,' Menendez said during a January 21 Capitol Hill hearing. 'The more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran.' While he is not among the senate's super-rich elites, the New Jersey legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges: His legal defense fund has already collected, and spent, more than $1 million. Last week two of his Senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case, arguing that the senator's actions, and theirs, are protected by the U.S. Constitution's 'Speech or Debate' clause. Those words in America's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny, including Justice Department investigations, while they are actively working on legislation. THE DOCTOR: Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida ophthalmologist and a major Menendez donor, was ordered to pay back Medicare for $8.9 million in overbillings, and Menendez intervened with HHS for him . SEARCH WARRANT: A January 30 raid of Melgen's medical practice yielded van-loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files . According to the New Jersey Law Journal, aide Michael Barnard refused to answer 50 questions about Menendez's conversations with Sebelius and Tavenner, and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator's office and Melgen's lawyer-lobbyist about those conversations. Another more senior aide, former Menendez chief counsel Kerri Talbot, reportedly refused to testify about a separate matter. The grand jury wanted to know if Talbot had emailed a staffer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port-screening equipment \u2013 principally cargo-container x-ray machines \u2013 to the Dominican Republic. Melgen, the senator's donor, controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through. The x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband. NARCO-POLITICS: Dr. Melgen controlled a company that wanted a Dominican ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs. Menendez allegedly helped ensure the U.S. wouldn't provide the machines for free . In 2013 FBI agents and investigators from HHS raided Melgen's West Palm Beach, Florida medical office, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. Over a period of nearly 24 hours, then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing what news reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files. The Washington Post reported at the time that HHS auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments Melgen's practice billed to Medicare. Other news reports described an alleged scheme in which Melgen used leftover fluid from single-use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients, billing Medicare for a new vial with each treatment. The government typically paid $2,000 for each container, raising the possibility that Melgen could have overbilled Medicare between $4,000 and $6,000 per vial.\n",

But the estate agent's blurb is actually for Britain's most expensive car parking space - which has just put been on the market for nearly \u00a3500,000. The 'fantastic' underground parking space is located in Kingston House in Kensington, one of the most affluent areas of London. Britain's most expensive car parking space, in Kensington, London, has been put on the market for \u00a3480,000 . The 'fantastic' underground parking space, which is a triple bay, is located in Kingston House (pictured) A resident's parking permit in Kensington and Chelsea, where the car parking space is located, typically costs up to \u00a3207 per year depending on the car's carbon dioxide emissions . Described as 'spacious', the triple parking bay comes with 24-hour security, a valet service and extensive state-of-the-art CCTV. There is also a complex ventilation system which ensures the regular flow of clean and extraction of carbon monoxide emissions. The parking space has been put on the market with Foxtons for \u00a3480,000. With stamp duty, the buyer will end up paying a total of \u00a3494,000 - three times the price of the average home in England and Wales and the same price as a pretty cottage in the Cotswolds. With the same money, you could also buy three plush Ferrari 458s, 50 new Ford Fiestas or a lavish superyacht. On top of this, the purchaser will also have to pay an additional \u00a31,500 per year service charge. The bay is one of two triple spaces currently for sale in the underground car park. The other one costs \u00a3390,000. There is also a single space for \u00a3132,000. Paul Wallace, who runs the YouTube channel Supercars of London, believes it is unfortunately a price to pay for keeping your cars safe. The same amount could buy you this quaint country cottage in Costwolds village Bourton-on-the-Hill . It could also buy you this lavish 16th century castle, which has six bedrooms, in\u00a0By Chryston, Glasgow . He said: 'You might think the super wealthy residents of Central London would have unlimited secure parking spaces, but it is becoming more apparent that this is not the case. 'There are lots of \u00a3200,000 supercars left on the side of the roads overnight, which exposes the cars to having wing mirrors clipped, rain and pollution on paintwork and even worse. '\u00a3480,000 is an very excessive cost to keep your car safe at night, but it's relatively essential with potential vandals.' The Kingston House car park, on Prince's Gate, can house a maximum of 144 cars. As part of a multi-million pound renovation, engineers installed a state of the art ventilation and fume extraction system which is designed to 'ensure the regular flow of clean air throughout the car park and the extraction of harmful carbon monoxide emissions'. The \u00a3480,000 - which would also have stamp duty added on - \u00a0could also buy you this luxury yacht . A prospective buyer could also swap the parking space for three of these cars, a Ferrari 458 . On its website, Kingston House Private Parking described the car park as a '5 star parking facility deserving of our discerning clients'. Henry Pryor, a property expert, described the \u00a3480,000 triple car parking spot as a 'reasonable expenditure' for the right person. He said: 'Secure parking in central London is particularly valuable at the moment with homeowners keener than usual for serviced and underground spaces in the light of recent keyless entry car crimes. 'In Kensington and Chelsea it costs \u00a34 per hour to park, for 10-12 hours a day, most days of the year. 'So it is not an absurd alternative to paying the council - although it is a lot more than a resident's parking permit.' A resident's parking permit in Kensington and Chelsea typically costs up to \u00a3207 per year depending on the car's carbon dioxide emissions.\n",

        "input": "Manu Tuilagi's recovery from a persistent groin injury remains a distant prospect and the wrecking-ball centre is racing to be fit to play any further rugby this season. The 23-year-old has not played since being forced off during Leicester\u2019s Champions Cup tie against Ulster last October. The initial prognosis was that he would be sidelined for six to eight weeks, but that was soon exposed as wishful thinking. A series of target dates for his comeback have come and gone, and now it appears Tuilagi won\u2019t resurface until the last month of the season \u2014 if at all. Manu Tuilagi has not featured since injuring his groin playing for Leicester back in October . The England centre is in a race against time to be fit for the World Cup, starting in September . Sportsmail understands he is setting his sights on playing four or five games for the Tigers in late April and May, but only time will tell if that ambition can be realised. England were already resigned to being without their midfield colossus for the entire RBS 6 Nations campaign, but having had Tuilagi in camp to oversee his rehabilitation, the management are aware that he is not close to being match-ready. The latest bulletin represented another setback in an alarmingly drawn-out recovery. \u2018He is making good progress and is doing straight line running, but he still has some way to go,\u2019 said head coach Stuart Lancaster ahead of another Calcutta Cup encounter which will not feature Tuilagi. \u2018I think he\u2019ll come good at the end of the season. Certainly Phil Pask (physio) has done a good job with him, but it\u2019s not in the near future. By the end of the season he\u2019ll be back playing. \u2018It is about making sure his groin and the healing around it is strong enough to cope with the forces he puts through it. He is a powerful man and he needs to make sure the groin has healed sufficiently. It is a step-by-step process to make sure he does not re-injure it, so that is why people are very cautious.\u2019 Leicester and England are keen to build their attacking game around Tuilagi\u2019s forceful ball-carrying but the pattern in the last two years has been for longer spells injured than fit. He has made only four appearances for the Tigers this season, following a modest tally of 10 last season in a campaign disrupted by a prolonged recovery from a pectoral injury. Tuilagi is a destructive figure but when he breaks down it takes a long time for his powerful body to heal. In early December, his club\u2019s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, predicted an imminent return and outlined just what Leicester and England were missing. \u2018Manu should be back by the end of December,\u2019 he said at the time. \u2018In the modern game you\u2019ve got to be able to dent the line of the opposition \u2014 you need physicality and Manu gives you that. He has been huge for England. The midfield is the biggest problem England have and Manu gives you that one position solved.\u2019 Tuilagi could make a return in the final month of the season but his World Cup place is in jeopardy . Tuilagi has struggled with injury over the past two seasons and has only played nine Tests since 2012 . Worryingly for Lancaster and his assistants, uncertainty over Tuilagi\u2019s ability to withstand the rigours of his profession remains part of the problem. In 2012, he played 10 times for his country, culminating in a devastating contribution to the record win over the All Blacks at Twickenham. Since then he has made only nine Test appearances, four of them as a replacement and one of those for the Lions on a tour where his impact was undermined by yet another injury. Despite attempts to alleviate his condition using prolotherapy \u2014 involving injections of a sugar solution into the bone \u2014 it is thought that a recent improvement has been brought about by intensive physiotherapy. Leicester will hope his best-case scenario of a return for the business end of the season ignites their Aviva Premiership title challenge, while England will want Tuilagi to join their initial World Cup training squad in June, ready to play a full, active part. England head coach Stuart Lancaster confirmed Tuilagi is no closer to making a return . Lancaster oversees training as his side prepare to face Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday . How England will line up against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday . He remains the most potent weapon in the team\u2019s back-line, when available. He can splinter the best defences and has even spooked the All Blacks with his explosive exploits in midfield. That continues to be the primary area of concern for Lancaster despite the advances made by Jonathan Joseph during this championship, to the extent that Henry Slade and Sam Burgess have been under close scrutiny in camp this week. That pair are seen as World Cup contenders. Billy Twelvetrees appears to be running out of chances to prove his Test credentials at 12, Luther Burrell is striving to claim that position and Kyle Eastmond appears to have been tried and discarded. Lancaster has said Tuilagi will be considered at inside centre, if that is the position to fill, while he was even shunted out to the wing in New Zealand last June. Whatever the number on his back, England will surely pick him, but by now they would ideally have spent ample time fine-tuning their centre combination. Instead, if Tuilagi is eventually cleared for a comeback, there will be a maximum of three pre- tournament friendlies to reintegrate him before the main event comes around.\n",

The attackers then burned down the entire village of Njaba, the sources said. Dozens of gunmen invaded the remote northeastern village before dawn Tuesday, singling out boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 19 and killing them alongside their parents, witnesses said. Njaba village lies about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Karimu Lawani, who escaped to Maiduguri after hiding with eight other people behind the barn of a neighbor, said the attackers came into the village at around 5 a.m. \"They shot dead anyone that tried to flee but spared children younger than 13 years old,\" Lawani said. He and other survivors counted the victims of the massacre before leaving the village some hours later. His account was supported by Faltama Bisika, 62, who lost four grandchildren in the attack. \"They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee. They particularly targeted teenagers and elderly people,\" Bisika said. News of the attack was slow to emerge due to lack of communication following destruction of cell phone towers in the region in previous Boko Haram attacks. \"I only got information of the attack on my village last night,\" said a civilian vigilante from Njaba who asked not to be named. The vigilante said his father was among those killed. The vigilante said he left Njaba for Maiduguri in June to join others fighting against the Islamist radical group. He said he believes the attackers came from Gwoza -- a town on Nigeria's mountainous border with Cameroon that Boko Haram seized last June -- because Njaba \"lies on the route to Gwoza from Maiduguri.\"\n",

        "input": "Washington (CNN)Updates on Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and John Kasich, an economic twist on the old adage \"All politics is local,\" and an overseas vote where President Obama would love to see an anti-incumbent backlash -- those stories filled our Sunday trip around the \"Inside Politics\" table. The official White House line will be something like this: The Israeli people are making their choice, the United States admires their vibrant democracy and looks forward to a close friendship and strategic partnership with the next Israeli government no matter who wins. But it's no secret President Obama is no fan of Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Israeli prime minister's recent address to a joint meeting of the Congress exposed the rawness of the relationship. So as the votes are counted and the coalitions debated in the week ahead, the White House has both a personal and professional interest. NPR's Steve Inskeep took a firsthand look at the Israeli campaign in the final days and offered his take on the uncertainty. \"Now, Israel's political system is so complicated that even if (Netanyahu's) party ends up not being the leading party, there are scenarios where he could end up in a governing coalition,\" said Inskeep. \"But it's interesting to note that Isaac Herzog, the Labor Party leader, who's his biggest challenger, wants to change Israel's approach to the world -- has been talking about trying to end Israel's isolation in the world, which would suggest changing a lot of policies that have infuriated this White House or frustrated this White House over the last several years.\" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tend to be at the top of GOP presidential polls these days, and a good deal has been written of late about a growing rivalry. But Maggie Haberman of The New York Times took us inside some recent big-money conversations during which Walker took a more diplomatic approach when asked about his potential nomination rival. Walker was in New York City last week for fund-raising meet and greets, and he met with some hedge fund executives who were very impressed by him. New York Observer owner Jared Kushner was also on hand. \"He was asked how he would beat Jeb Bush, and he surprised a bunch of people by saying Jeb Bush is the front-runner,\" said Haberman. \"Now, that's contrary to a lot of other things he said publicly last week.\" \"But that is his sell to people who could give him money, which is: 'No, no, (Bush) is the front-runner but I'm the slow and steady guy who's going to come up behind, just like when I ran track when I was younger.'\" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida at times appears to be the odd man out in the early GOP presidential rankings. Jeb Bush's aggressive entry into the race raised some questions about whether there would still be space for Rubio to tap Florida's deep fund-raising well. Then came the Scott Walker boomlet, and talk among some conservatives that the Wisconsin governor -- not Rubio -- might be the best pick for a new generation GOP standard-bearer. But Rubio has continued to build his team and travel to the early states on the nomination calendar, and Robert Costa of The Washington Post shared news of a developing relationship between the senator and the party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney. \"He's spoken with Romney twice since Romney decided not to get in the race,\" said Costa. \"And he has had meetings this week with people like Lanhee Chen, Romney's former policy director, and inputs often with Spencer Zwick, Romney's former finance director.\" \"I think Rubio, if he nurtures those relationships, we'll see him continue to rise in the donor community and with consultants and voters.\" Ohio Gov. John Kasich is about to make his first New Hampshire foray of the 2016 cycle and is getting some encouragement from important players in the first-in-the-nation primary state. Kasich, who is exploring running but hasn't been as aggressive as many other GOPers in terms of travel and staff recruitment, will be in New Hampshire on March 24 for the Politics and Eggs breakfast, a rite of presidential passage sponsored by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. Word from people familiar with the trip is that Kasich is being encouraged to be more active in New Hampshire by former Gov. John H. Sununu and his son, former GOP Sen. John Sununu. Two New Hampshire GOP activists also report that former GOP Sen. Judd Gregg also believes Kasich -- like Gregg, a budget hawk during his time in Congress -- would be a strong addition to the GOP field. There is a crowded field of Republicans testing the waters for 2016 -- and the people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina are grateful. They don't have as much reason to be grateful to the Democrats, who so far seem to be fixated on a single candidate. The lack of a big field will likely spare Hillary Clinton a damaging mess, as California Gov. Jerry Brown suggested last week. But, party loyalties aside, perhaps he would have a different take if his state were near the top of the nominating calendar. Julie Pace of The Associated Press reminded us the early presidential attention is an economic engine in those early states. \"When you have robust primaries in both parties, you have tons of money flooding into Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina, on television ads, on hotels, transportation, campaign headquarters,\" said Pace. \"And there is some concern that on the Democratic side, we're just simply not going to see that this time around.\" \"And it's a reminder that politics has become such a big business beyond just the campaigns and the super PACs.\"\n",

        "input": "Moscow (CNN)This was supposed to be a rally led by Boris Nemtsov, had he lived two more days to see it. But after the Russian opposition figure was gunned down Friday night, Sunday's rally in Moscow took on a different theme. Instead of gathering to criticize Russia's policies on Ukraine, thousands of people came together to mourn the death of the former deputy prime minister. And as they united near the site of Nemtsov's death, conspiracy theories swirled over who killed the staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin as he walked near the Kremlin with his Ukrainian model companion. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko added fuel to the conspiracists' fire by saying Saturday that Nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to Russian interests, according to Ukrinform, the state-run news agency. \"A few weeks ago I had a conversation with him on how to build relations between Ukraine and Russia, as we would like them to be. Boris said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine. Someone was very afraid of that. Boris was not afraid, the executioners were afraid. They killed him,\" Ukrinform quoted Poroshenko as saying. Russian authorities originally declined to issue a permit for the march when it was billed as an opposition rally. But they agreed to allow the procession honoring Nemtsov, said People's Freedom Party leader Mikhail Kasyanov. Nemtsov was a top official in the party. The 55-year-old was walking home from dinner with a companion, 23-year-old Anna Duritskaya, when he was killed. The model later called Ilya Yashin, a friend and political colleague of Nemtsov's, and said several men had pulled up in a car, and one opened fire, Yashin said. Russian TV station LifeNews spoke with a snowplow driver, who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the slaying. He was identified as \"Sergey B.\" \"I got on the bridge, looked into the rear mirror and saw a man on the ground. I immediately realized he didn't feel well. I drove a little bit further and pulled over,\" the driver said. \"I realized we needed to call the ambulance and police.\" In a statement on its website, the Investigative Committee for the Russian Federation said the shooter likely used a Russian-made Makarov pistol and 9 mm shells were collected at the scene. Police say they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5-foot-7 and 5-foot-9, Russia's Sputnik news agency reported. The shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater. Several possible motives were being investigated, the committee said, including the prospect that the shooting was a \"provocation to destabilize the political situation in the country.\" The committee is also exploring the possibility that the killing is related to the Charlie Hebdo terror attack in Paris or Nemtsov's business activities, it said. The committee is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ($49,000) for information about the crime, several media outlets reported. Investigators interviewed Duritskaya, who was not wounded. She was reportedly being kept under guard at an apartment, and Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has requested that Duritskaya be allowed to return to Ukraine, according to TASS, a Russian news agency. Putin quickly condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, the Kremlin said in a statement. The President also wrote to Nemtsov's mother saying he shared her grief and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice, the Kremlin said. But some of Nemtsov's fellow critics suspect involvement by either Putin's administration or a supporter of the President. \"It's clearly a political murder. It's definitely a contract one,\" Yashin said. \"I don't know who killed Boris, but I know that it's the government and personally Putin who are responsible for it. They've been constantly promoting a hatred towards everyone who doesn't support their course and thinks different.\" Putin had a different theory: that the killing was a contract hit, but one meant to fire up political strife, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Nemtsov himself had said he was at risk for assassination. He told the Russian newspaper Sobesednik last month that he was \"a little bit\" afraid his mother's fears Putin would have him killed would come true. But, he added, \"I'm not afraid of him that much. If I was afraid I wouldn't be heading an opposition party and do what I'm doing.\" Last year, Nemtsov spoke to CNN's Anthony Bourdain. \"I'm (a) well-known guy, and this is a safety because if something happens with me, it will be scandal not only in Moscow city but throughout the world,\" he said then. Critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable fates. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps. Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put Putin in power. He was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in London in 2006. No killer has been caught. And before his death, Nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011, when he protested the results of parliamentary elections, and in 2012, when tens of thousands protested against Putin. While Nemtsov certainly had his share of enemies in Russia -- especially those who disagree with his stance on the Ukrainian conflict -- many left notes for the slain politician on the bridge where he was killed. \"To Boris Nemtsov,\" one letter read, \"Thank you for your example of courage and honesty.\" Human rights activists did not mince words in assigning blame for Nemtsov's murder. Tweeted Garry Kasparov, chairman of the Human Rights Foundation's International Council: \"If you are popular your critics don't have to be shot down in front of the Kremlin. Putin is just food in a prison, eat it or starve.\" In a column on how Nemtsov had been harassed for his regular criticism of the Kremlin, Human Rights Watch's Tanya Cooper lambasted Peskov, the Putin spokesman, for saying the killing appeared to be an attempt to destabilize Russia -- a statement Cooper said could prejudice the investigation. \"Russia has become the kind of place where a top opposition leader can be murdered just steps away from the president's office,\" she wrote. \"A country in which people are told to hate one another for difference of opinions is a dangerous country to live in.\" Frederik Pleitgen and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow; Holly Yan and Eliott C. McLaughlin reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Matthew Chance in Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark in London contributed to this report.\n",

But the board will remain remarkably different from the company director structure at the top of other multi-billion-pound businesses. The three-strong PL version is expected to consist of just Scudamore and two newly appointed independent directors to be unveiled on Thursday, who will hopefully provide some gender and race diversity. Richard Scudamore (left) will be elevated from CEO to Premier League chairman at Thursday's club summit and be joined by two newly appointed independent directors . FA chairman Greg Dyke will be under pressure to explain his campaign for more homegrown players . The formation, which will need a change of PL statutes, is at least a step nearer fit-for-purpose governance than the current two-man board of Scudamore and Peter McCormick, the interim chairman who is standing down. The PL still regard their six-times-a-year club summits as board meetings with their 20 shareholders, despite most of the top-flight foreign owners never bothering to attend. Meanwhile, FA chairman Greg Dyke has tended to keep quiet in PL meetings, but he will be under pressure on Thursday to explain his campaign for more homegrown players in PL squads to help the national team. Dyke has strong backing from UEFA for this initiative, which hasn\u2019t been supported by the PL representatives on the FA board. It will not please Derby fans but the strong word is that their manager Steve McClaren is heading for Newcastle at the end of the season, irrespective of whether County are promoted. It would seem odd for McClaren, who will not comment about his future, to swap the solid Derby set-up for the madness of St James\u2019 Park, but football rarely fails to surprise. Derby manager Steve McClaren is looking a strong possibility to head to Newcastle at the end of the season . Surrey were seemingly expecting their entire global membership to buy tickets for Kevin Pietersen\u2019s return this season, judging by emails received on Wednesday from Ticketmaster confirming the purchase of seats. The botched memos went to the full Surrey database, much to the county\u2019s embarrassment, with a phone message on the Oval ticket office voicemail telling callers to disregard the mass posting. Ticketmaster are infamous for their computer system continually crashing during the sale of London 2012 Olympic seats. Kevin Pietersen's signing back at Surrey coincided with a bothed mass email to members about tickets . Giles Clarke, who stands down as ECB chairman in May, has been the loudest autocratic voice on most English cricket issues since he took the helm in 2008. Yet Clarke has chosen to stay noticeably silent on Kevin Pietersen\u2019s return to Surrey. The Football League are taking a lot longer than promised to probe the Financial Fair Play returns of Leicester and QPR. The Leicester issue centres on a Far East marketing deal to offset losses, agreed with a Sheffield agency owned by former Premier League chairman Sir Dave Richards and his son.

US football heads are fearing David Beckham\u2019s Major League Soccer plans could out of time .

        "input": "There seemed to be a medal on every uniform \u2013 be it military or school. Three Victoria Crosses, four George Crosses, 1,650 gallantry decorations and tens of thousands of campaign medals were awarded during Britain\u2019s 13-year action in Afghanistan. Yesterday, as the country gathered to honour that campaign at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, several children were wearing the medals of fathers who never returned from the war against the Taliban. Scroll down for video . Gallant: Prince Philip, 93, guides the Queen down the steps of St Paul's Cathedral after Friday's service . It was the Queen who led the nation\u2019s tribute, supported by the 93-year-old Duke of Edinburgh (literally so when it came to negotiating the steps of St Paul\u2019s). In pride of place behind her were the holders of another decoration. The Elizabeth Cross is the medal no one wants. Yet no decoration, surely, is worn with greater pride. Devised by the sovereign at the height of the Afghan conflict in 2009, it is a silver brooch presented to the next of kin of every member of the Armed Forces killed in the line of duty \u2013 and there were 453 of those in Afghanistan. Yesterday, the families of every single one had been invited to join the Queen at St Paul\u2019s. Historians and politicians will still be debating the merits of the Afghan project years from now. But the bravery and determination of those called upon to serve there has never been in question. Hence the decision to recognise their collective efforts with a formal act of worship and a parade through the City of London. Entitled \u2018A Service of Commemoration, Reflection and Remembrance\u2019 (\u2018thanksgiving\u2019 might have been triumphal), this was a state occasion of the highest order. All the senior members of the Royal Family \u2013 including Afghan veteran Prince Harry \u2013 and all the Service chiefs were present, along with the three main party leaders plus representatives of our Nato allies and all the main faiths. For dad: Charlton Taylor, five, son of Royal Marine Michael Taylor who was killed in Afghanistan in June 2010 . Remembered: Charlton (left) wore the medals awarded to his father (right) who was just 30 when he died . Past prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were also present. They had front row seats in the South Transept, flanked by senior Forces personnel rather than grieving families. In the run-up to this service some had questioned the presence of the leaders who took Britain into this conflict. There would, of course, have been louder criticism had the two men stayed away. Even so, great delicacy was required. At the close, the ex-PMs were out of a side door and off the premises before the royal chauffeurs had even started their engines. By far the largest section of the 2,600-strong congregation \u2013 more numerous, even, than the veterans themselves \u2013 were the bereaved. For each holder of the Elizabeth Cross had been granted two invitations \u2013 and quite right, too. There were some desperately poignant sights; a schoolboy with Dad\u2019s medals sitting alongside Mum, in black, with her Elizabeth Cross on her lapel and tissues clasped tightly in her hand; a middle-aged couple blinking back tears; a young mother, dressed in black, dashing for the door with a small, screaming boy in her arms during the opening prayers. It\u2019s rare to see a toddler at a state occasion. Presumably, the little chap was there to honour a gallant father or uncle. Touching moment: Prince Charles with Forces families at the reception at the Guildhall after the service . I hope they were both allowed back in. Because this was a magnificent service, a finely judged blend of tradition, innovation, stirring but non-martial music and audience participation. Among half a dozen worshippers chosen to read the prayers of intercession were a senior RAF officer, former Corporal Sarah Bushbye MC, who won her Military Cross dashing through a maelstrom of gunfire to treat four wounded soldiers, and Kerry Ashworth, mother of Lance Corporal James Ashworth of the Grenadier Guards. He won a posthumous VC for his attack on Taliban positions in 2012. \u2018For peacemakers and peacekeepers who seek to keep this world secure and free, may God give peace,\u2019 declared Mrs Ashworth faultlessly, her son\u2019s VC pinned alongside her EC. Seats were left empty at the service as family members of the 453 who died chose not to attend. Relatives travelled to London to watch the service on a screen outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral \u2013 even though more than 40 seats were left unoccupied inside. Graham Knight, whose son Sergeant Ben Knight, 25, was killed in an explosion in 2006, was one who declined the invitation. Mr Knight, from John O\u2019 Groats, said: \u2018It is more of a public relations exercise, with the good and the great at the front and all the relatives at the back. We don\u2019t need to go to a service like that to remember our son, we remember him every day.\u2019 Around 20 bereaved family members and veterans were either unwell or unable to travel at the last minute and did not attend the service. Another 15 to 20 bereaved family members and veterans unexpectedly did not turn up. A Ministry of Defence source said: \u2018It\u2019s understandable that on such an emotional day for so many people there were some who felt they couldn\u2019t attend today\u2019s service.\u2019 After a lesson from Prime Minister David Cameron (\u2018Blessed are the peacemakers\u2026\u2019), the Bishop of London shared his readings with 13-year-old Tyler Barrow from Hampshire. Tyler still remembers the day in 2007 when his father, Captain Gary Barrow of the King\u2019s Royal Hussars, was so badly wounded he had to be evacuated back to Britain. But Captain Barrow made a full recovery and went on to complete a further two tours of duty. It was hard to tell who was proudest of whom when I met them yesterday. \u2018I\u2019m more nervous than he is,\u2019 Captain Barrow admitted before the service. In another emotionally charged moment, the Bastion Cross was carried the full length of the cathedral in a procession of its own. Originally knocked together from old shell cases at Camp Bastion, this brass crucifix became a shrine for troops in the field. Yesterday, before the Head of the Armed Forces herself, it was formally rededicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Rev Justin Welby. The Archbishop based his short sermon on the words of the prophet, Jeremiah: \u2018Great is your faithfulness.\u2019 Thanking all the troops, he also lauded the vast support network behind them. \u2018I\u2019m told that each wounded person was supported by up to 80 others by the time they got home.\u2019 And he had stirring words for the home front. \u2018We also thank those of you who stayed behind, who let your loved ones go; you who worried for their safety each day, took your phone to your bedside each night. Great is your faithfulness.\u2019 Departing to Bach\u2019s Prelude and Fugue in B Minor, the Queen was introduced to another cross-section of those whose lives were turned upside down by this conflict. Corporal Matthew Webb of the Royal Marines is now a triple amputee. Sally Thorneloe lost her husband, Lieutenant-Colonel Rupert Thorneloe of the Welsh Guards, the most senior officer killed in the conflict. Yesterday, she was accompanied by her daughters, Hannah, nine, and Sophie, seven, who presented flowers to the Queen. Respects: The Queen receives flowers from sisters Sophie (right) and Hannah Thorneloe (second right), whose father Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe was the most senior officer to be killed in Afghanistan . In front of the cathedral, the parade was forming up. Detachments from all the Services marched the short distance to a Guildhall reception while an RAF flypast \u2013 including that great Afghan warhorse, the Chinook \u2013 flew overhead. Thousands of onlookers, many of them City workers, had turned out to clap them all. I am glad to report that I neither saw nor heard a single protester, just lots of polite, heartfelt applause. Some of the loudest was for those bringing up the rear \u2013 the families. For many, the last experience of something like this was the raw agony of the homecoming parade at Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire. Yesterday should leave them with a sunnier memory. \u2018No tears today. That was beautiful and we are smiling,\u2019 said Elizabeth Daniels of Hyde, Lancashire, beneath a glorious lime green hat. She was here to remember her beloved brother, Corporal Harvey Holmes, and to support her mother Beverley Mayall. Parents-to-be: Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge also attended the moving service . At Guildhall I met Brenda Wilson and her daughter Rachel Stanley, 27. Her Elizabeth Cross pinned proudly to her coat, Brenda had bumped into some old comrades of her son, Corporal Jack Stanley of the Queen\u2019s Royal Hussars, who died on Easter Sunday 2012. \u2018I cannot fault anything about today. It\u2019s been wonderful,\u2019 she said. \u2018Coming here, you realise you\u2019re not on your own. You\u2019re part of an enormous family.\u2019 It may be a family that has known great pain. But yesterday will undoubtedly have left it stronger. As peek-a-boo Ed nods off... his two predecessors sneak out the back door . Tony and Gordon Brown attended the service but left out of a back entrance of St Paul\u2019s to avoid coming face to face with the families of those who died in Afghanistan. Mr Blair, the prime minister who took Britain to war, and his successor left several minutes before the other guests, escorted by bodyguards to separate BMW saloons. Relatives had reacted with fury last week when told Mr Blair and Mr Brown would be among the congregation, with one saying Mr Blair has \u2018got blood on his hands\u2019. A spokesman for Mr Blair said he had to leave quickly to fly to an economic conference in Egypt.

Reports claim Android, as well as BlackBerry and potentially Windows Phone customers, will be able to exchange their handsets for gift cards and credit towards an Apple product . These reports first appeared on fan site 9to5Mac and came from unnamed sources. Apple launched its iPhone Reuse and Recycle trade-in scheme in 2013. It lets people take old handsets into a store and get credit to put towards the purchase of a new one. These handsets can be recycled online too, and Apple offers an iPad version of the scheme. The amount of credit depends on the device and its condition, and its likely that figures for Android handsets, which are typically much cheaper than Apple phones, will be low under the scheme. Apple has not confirmed these plans but the report said the scheme could roll out 'in the coming weeks.'\u00a0The latest smartphone sales data show that Apple\u2019s share of sales grew last year thanks to the iPhone 6 (left).

        "input": "This is the dramatic moment four fearless Indian bison managed to avoid certain death by chasing a giant tiger away from their herd. Praveen Siddannavar, 47, captured the stunning shots as the Indian bison, also known as gaurs, teamed up to frighten away their would-be killer at the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in the Karnataka State of India. The photographer, from Bangalore, says he looked on with amazement as the animals clashed near a water puddle - with the gaurs standing their ground before the tiger made a run for it. The chase: The group of Indian bison teamed up to frighten away their would-be killer at the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in India . On the prowl: The tiger was walking in the open, heading straight towards a water pipe where the group of bison were having a drink . On high alert: One of the gaurs picked up on the scent of the approaching tiger and made all the others aware of its presence . Speaking of the incident, Mr Siddannavar said: 'I was enjoying a late afternoon drive and after scanning the forest and I drove to the sunset point on the backwaters of river Kabini that had gone completely dry due to poor monsoons'. 'I was fortunate to spot a huge tiger resting underneath the shade of dried bamboo bushes,' he added. 'After a while the tiger started walking in the open and loud alarm calls were given by spotted deer and also the Sambar deer. The tiger ignored these calls and headed straight towards the culvert [water pipe] to cool himself in a puddle,' he went on to say. Mr Siddannavar said that a herd of gaurs were heading the same way to quench their thirst - a sight that 'really excited' him as he knew he was going to see some action. One of the gaurs then picked up on the scent of the tiger and they were all alerted. 'The gaurs seemed uncomfortable upon seeing the tiger and decided to launch an offensive attack,' the photographer said. Not going easy: The gaurs were uncomfortable at the presence of the massive tiger and decided to launch an offensive attack . Running scared: As soon as the four Indian bison charged at their would-be killer, the tiger decided he wasn't going to hang around . Filled with fear: The four bison chased the tiger, who seemed more interested in saving his own life than making a kill . Mr Siddannavar said the the entire herd of gaurs stormed towards the tiger, after first snorting aggressively. As soon as the animals charged, the photographer said, their would-be killer decided to run away.' The photographer admitted he was stunned to see the tiger backing away from its prey and said the gaurs proved to be a formidable force. 'What an unbelievable sight this was - I have never seen such action-packed drama before,'\u00a0Mr Siddannavar said. 'Tigers are apex predators - meaning they are at the top of the food chain in the forest ecosystem,' he added. Great defence: Praveen Siddannavar said the the entire herd of gaurs stormed towards the tiger, after first snorting aggressively . Safe: After being chased away from the scene, the tiger went back to sheltering under the safety of dry bamboo trees . All in a day's work: After seeing off the tiger, the gaurs wandered off into the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, in India's Karnataka State . Mr Siddannavar said gaurs are not normally scared of other animals, but taking on a tiger showed particular unity, strength and bravery. 'Tigers hunt gaurs regularly but it was amazing to see them working together - their strength lies in numbers and unity plays a key role in fending a tiger away,' he said. 'It really surprised me to see the tiger running away as tigers rarely back off as they are the kings of the jungles,' he added. 'But because it was a group of four gaurs and they attacked from all ends, the tiger had no option but to run away to save his life.' Photographer: Praveen Siddannavar, 47, says he looked on with amazement as the animals clashed near a water puddle - with the gaurs standing their ground before the tiger made a run for it .\n",

He and Camilla, Duchess of Cambridge, joined onlookers at the Lamb National, in which agile Herdwick sheep hurtle around a specially-built course, leaping over special jumps on a grassy course. The event, which was part of the Prince's Countryside Fund Raceday, clearly tickled Charles who was forced to cover his face as he roared with laughter at the farm animals' antics. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles catches sight of the sheep hurtling over jumps at the Lamb National in Ascot . The royal soon gets the giggles as the Duchess of Cambridge laughs along with him . Perhaps it was the sight of the sheep's cuddly toy 'jockeys' that made the prince roar with laughter? Camilla laughed along with him, clearly enjoying the sight of the sheep clad in their multi-coloured coats hurtling around the course. And each one had a little 'rider', a cuddly toy dressed a jockey's uniform, holding on to the sheep's reins . The couple were flanked by Conde Nast president Nicholas Coleridge and Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, who looked equally amused by the fluffy runners. Charles has an added interest in the race as he's patron of the Campaign for Wool (which sponsored the event), a initiative he launched to raise awareness of British wool in fashion, interiors and industry.

Clutching her headgear with both leather gloved hands, Camilla, who looked elegant in a tweed coat with velvet trim, a silk scarf and knee-high brown suede boots, found her coat whipped open. And as the rain fell, she opened up her clear umbrella as protection against the elements.

The actor said he chooses to bear witness to the gruesome clips, in which Americans, Britons and Kurds have been graphically slaughtered, because 'real violence' is often hidden from us. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'The problem is we are not seeing enough of real violence. We are being anesthetized when you don't see the horror of war.' 'Real violence': Sean Penn, pictured left in his new film The Gunman, said he watches ISIS's propaganda videos showing hostages like James Foley, right, being beheaded . When asked whether he felt morally obliged to view the clips, he replied that he did. Penn said that the graphic reality of the murder videos counteracts 'political correctness', which has led upsetting images from conflict such as that in Iraq and Afghanistan from being kept off-screen. He also mentioned the ISIS clips in relation to his own new movie, The Gunman, which will feature graphic violence. Penn said that staged violence in movies and the real violence such as that being perpetrated in Iraq and Syria are not the same thing. Violence in movies: Penn made a point of differentiating fictional violence, like that in his new film, above, from real-life acts by the likes of ISIS . He said: 'Anyone who sees them [ISIS videos] and claims that they were anaesthetised by violent movies, that they weren't horrified by what they saw, on the most primal level, is intellectually dishonest or existentially unpresent.' Penn has voice his opinions about ISIS before - earlier this week he told Conan O'Brien that the terrorist organization was 'created' by George W Bush and Dick Cheney. Beginning with former Vice President Cheney, whom he called 'an embittered bacteria [sic] of humanity', he said: 'These are the guys, he and President Bush and some others, who invented Daesh, or ISIS.' The video ends with three ISIS fighters pulling out their knives and beheading their prisoner. Close up shots of the bloodied bodies are shown. He sarcastically added 'thanks for that'. Meanwhile ISIS continues to produce and distribute sickening videos of its barbaric executions. Its warped criminal justice system has given rise to footage of people thrown off buildings for being homosexual, and having hands amputated for other crimes. On Friday its latest beheading video was released, showing the killing of three Kurdish soldiers who had been taken prisoner.\n",

When Thoronka, the country's number one 100m sprinter, left Sierra Leone for Glasgow, some Ebola cases had been confirmed in a few of the villages surrounding Freetown, but the epidemic had not yet taken hold of the capital. The death toll in the country is now more than 3,500 cases. The runner said: 'I was hoping to win a medal for my country.

I've gone for a physical side and runners. Hopefully I'm right. 'It's purely tactical and there certainly hasn't been a lack of enthusiasm from Jack about playing for Scotland.'

There will also be a 3 per cent increase in the rate for 18 to 20-year-olds, to \u00a35.30 per hour. The minimum wage for 16 to 17-year-olds will go up by 2 per cent, to \u00a33.87 per hour. Mr Cameron said: 'At the heart of our long-term economic plan for Britain is a simple idea ... that hard work is really rewarded, that the benefits of recovery are truly national . \u2018That\u2019s what today\u2019s announcement is all about \u2013 saying to hardworking taxpayers, this is a Government that is on your side. It will mean more financial security for Britain\u2019s families; and a better future for our country.\u2019 Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg said: \u2018This is just one of the many ways in which we\u2019ve created a fairer society whilst building a stronger economy. If you work hard, this government is behind you all the way. Whether you\u2019re on low pay or starting your dream career through an apprenticeship, you will get more support to help you go further and faster.\u2019 Senior Tories are calling on the Chancellor to go further, and consider tax breaks for firms who pay the \u2018living wage\u2019, set above the national minimum wage. The living wage is currently set at \u00a37.85 an hour outside London and \u00a39.15 in the capital. Ed Miliband has said he wants to increase the minimum wage to \u00a38 an hour by 2019. Mr Osborne has proposed a legal minimum of \u00a37 far sooner. The number of people on the national minimum wage has doubled since it was introduced 15 years ago and is now the pay rate for one in 20 workers, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. Around 1.2 million employees earn the legal minimum wage compared with just over 600,000 in 1999. A further 1.3m workers are clustered close to the minimum wage - earning within 50p of the minimum level. A series of below-inflation increases over recent years had meant the real-terms value of the wage had stalled. John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said: \u2018It\u2019s disappointing that the Government has rejected the Low Pay Commission\u2019s recommendation on the apprentice rate. \u2018The national minimum wage has been one of the most successful policies of recent years thanks to the independence of the commission \u2013 its politicisation is worrying.\u2019 Chuka Umunna, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, said: \u2018This 20p rise falls far short of the \u00a37 minimum wage which George Osborne promised over a year ago. Ministers have misled working families who have been left worse off. Where under David Cameron we\u2019ve seen the value of the minimum wage eroded, we need a recovery for working people. \u2018Only Labour has set a more ambitious target for the minimum wage which would see a rise to \u00a38 by 2020, restoring the link between hard work and pay. We would also act to ensure the national minimum wage is properly enforced where a Tory-led government has failed to get to grips with non-payment. 'Currently 15 per cent of apprentices are not being paid the legal minimum, rising to almost a quarter for 16- to 18-year-olds.\u2019\n",
        "output": "David Cameron set to announce that the minimum wage will rise to \u00a36.70 . This 3% rise is the biggest real-terms increase since the financial crisis . Rate for apprentices will go up by a fifth \u2013 the largest increase on record . Minimum wage for 16 to 17-year-olds will go up by 2% to \u00a33.87 per hour .\n"

        "input": "Karl Perryman allegedly stalked a female colleague after she spurned his advances, a court heard . A senior manager at an NHS hospital bombarded a female colleague with letters calling her a tart after she spurned his advances, a court heard today. The 'dark and spiteful' notes allegedly composed by head of complaints and legal services Karl Perryman, 52, accused Joanne O'Neill of cheating on her partner, dressing 'like a hooker' and 'sleeping her way to the top'. They also claimed the complaints manager had noisy sexual relations 'on hospital time' and warned ominously: 'You will reap what you sow.' A total of eight letters were sent to Miss O'Neill, her mother and other managers at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Norfolk. The letters began in December 2012 and were addressed to Ms O\u2019Neill, her partner, her line manager, her mother and the human resources manager at the hospital. They were supposedly from an anonymous Christian woman who worked at the hospital and wanted to put a stop to the 'deplorable conduct' of Miss O'Neill and deputy director of ICT Michael Brown. But a jury was told they were all written by Perryman after Miss O'Neill rejected his attention and began a relationship with Mr Brown. Prosecutor Jude Durr said: 'These letters had dark and spiteful undertones. All concerned rank, status, sex, lying, cheating, flirting, dressing inappropriately and reaping what you sow. 'By the time she made a statement\u2026 these letters had already had a significant effect on her life. 'She felt genuinely frightened that she was being watched every time she attended a meeting or saw a colleague in the corridor. It was also affecting her home life. 'She didn't at that stage have any idea who could be so vindictive and hateful. The invasion of her personal, professional and private life caused a real devastating fear of escalation.' Miss O'Neill was initially turned down for a job after an interview at the hospital, King's Lynn Crown Court was told. But Perryman is said to have called her afterwards to say he was 'so impressed with her as a candidate that he would do his damnedest to get her a job'. A couple of months later she began working in his department and he promised to 'take her under his wing'. He described her as his 'prodigy' and she soon began covering his job when he was on leave. The two shared friendly 'banter' but the relationship soured when he allegedly purchased a necklace for her from jewellers Ernest Jones and she refused the gift. He then sent a friend request on Facebook under the name Earnest Jones, which she declined. Perryman was head of complaints and legal services at Queen Elizabeth Hospital (pictured) in King's Lynn, Norfolk, when he allegedly bombarded colleague Joanne O'Neill with letters . At the time, her relationship with partner Phillip Twite, 39, was breaking down and she had begun a friendship with line manager Mr Brown. The first anonymous letter arrived at the hospital in December 2012 and said Mr Brown had been 'bragging' about having sex with Miss O'Neill and another female member of staff. It claimed: 'Both of these women are allowed to dress like hookers in short skirts and dresses\u2026 they are dressing like tarts. This is a hospital, not a knocking shop.' Two letters were sent to Mr Twite's home the following month in which the author claimed to have heard Miss O'Neill and Mr Brown having sex 'with my own ears'. One said: 'She has had many promotions she does not deserve even though she has been described as next to useless by senior clinicians\u2026 one manager even said she is sleeping her way to the top.' A few days later Miss O'Neill received a letter which accused her of 'plotting and scheming' for her own advantage. It warned: 'You will reap what you sow\u2026 we will listen to your corridor conversations, when you're in the bathroom, so we can get firm evidence for your partner with what you've done.' Another letter she received had biblical references and described her as 'Jo Jo Judas', while one to her mother, Margaret Titmarsh, claimed she had told people her father had sexually abused her. Miss O'Neill, who is now married to Mr Brown, told the jury\u00a0Perryman, who was her line manager, said he would 'destroy' her if she told anyone about his bullying. She said: 'He made me feel like he got me the job, I had to be loyal and I owed him. 'He said there were women who didn't like the way I looked, his wife wouldn't like me because I was just his type, petite and blonde. King's Lynn Crown Court (pictured) heard\u00a0Miss O'Neill was initially turned down for a job after an interview at the hospital . 'He said if I went against him he would destroy me, destroy my credibility and my career. It's worked because I've moved hundreds of miles away. 'He said he had something on everyone and if I spoke out no one would believe me.' She added: 'I was frightened because someone had written to my home address and said horrible things. I was shocked. 'It was upsetting as I was going through a break-up and felt like someone had intruded and was saying lies about me, which upset us both. 'What was going on between my partner and me was private. I felt humiliated.' The court heard police traced the letters to Perryman and found drafts on his computer. After his arrest he allegedly approached Mrs Titmarsh and threatened 'You don't know what's coming to you' while making a 'thumb across the throat' gesture. He denies one count of stalking and another of intimidating a witness. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",

The woman, who is from England, was visiting Dublin with a group of friends in fancy dress when they went into the Apache Pizza restaurant in the popular tourist destination of Temple Bar. One customer of the restaurant becomes involved in a heated discussion with a member of staff behind the counter, when a man from Dublin intervenes and the pair start grappling. One of the customers, second right, starts arguing with a member of staff behind the counter . A fellow customer steps in and tells the man that he would be willing to 'see him outside' Within seconds, both men start fighting while several customers begin filming the incident . Several customers try to split up both men, including the woman's boyfriend, as they start exchanging blows in the middle of the restaurant. The woman gets carried along on the outside of the group of men and slams the back of her head on the tiles after she falls over. For several seconds, nobody notices that the girl is unconscious as the two men continue trying to hit each other. The English guy is knocked to the floor and the Dublin man appears to try and stamp on him as the fight continues. Several of the customers film the drama on their mobile phones. Eventually, several people notice that the girl is in trouble and one woman tries to lift her from the ground, only to lose grip and leave her head crash against the tiles for a second time.

        "input": "Controversial radio presenter John Laws has revealed he was abused by a paedophile in a public toilet when he was a child. Laws, who recently came under fire for his tough on-air interview with a sex abuse victim, reducing the caller to tears, has admitted he was attacked in a public toilet in Sydney when he was 10 or 11 years old. 'I was a child. It was in a public lavatory at Mosman Oval. I didn\u2019t know the person. I was disturbed. I took off. I ran,' he told The Australian. 'I made it very clear that I didn\u2019t appreciate it. I would have shouted and yelled.' Scroll down for video . Radio broadcaster John Laws has defended his 10-minute on-air phone conversation with a listener named Brian . The revelation came just over a week after he reduced an elderly man, known only as Brian, to tears when the caller told the broadcaster he was abused as a child in the 1940s. Laws criticised Brian for not fighting the attacker off and called him a 'wet blanket'. But the radio veteran has defended his comments and said he did not think he had treated Brian insensitively. The interview earlier this month stirred an outrage among listeners, with some calling for his resignation over the comments. But Laws rebuked claims he had no sympathy for those who had been abused and said his reaction to Brian's story stemmed from how he had handled his own experience. Brian called Laws during his morning radio show on 2SM earlier this month and told him about his sexual abuse . He said his attacker was someone he did not know and he was left disturbed by the abuse, adding he would have made it 'very clear' he did not appreciate it by shouting and yelling. The broadcaster said his advice to Brian would have been how he would have reacted in the same situation, describing it as 'tough love'. When contacted by Daily Mail Australia, Laws did not wish to comment further on the matter. The shock jock called the elderly man a 'wet blanket' and suggested he should 'go to the pub and have a lemonade' In a 10-minute call, Brian told Laws about how he had been sexually abused on several occasions from the age of 11 to 14 live on Sydney radio station 2SM. Laws quipped and chuckled it 'took a little while for you to get around to talk about it'. Brian then told Laws he had in fact reported two instances to the police but he was told to 'go away and forget about it. No one would do anything about it'. It was at this stage, Laws added insult to injury as he told Brian that he should have fought the man off, as he himself had done when men had 'had a go' at him when he was younger. 'Did you scream in fright? Did you yell out 'stop that you bastard'? Did you lash out with your fists? Did you hit him?' Laws asked. The call outraged people on social media who called for the radio presenter's sacking after the call . A meek sounding Brian responded 'no, no probably not.' 'I don't quite understand why you didn't lash out, you would have been a fairly big boy by that time. Didn't you kick or yell or scream or hit?' Laws continued to press the issue and said he should have told his family or his boss, who it turns out was responsible for several of the assaults. Brian began to become audibly distressed at this stage when he explained he had no family support. 'No... there was no such thing as ... family love,' Brian said. He explained that his abuse was a contributing factor to why he had no girlfriend, no romantic interests and very little human contact. Laws then tried to salvage the conversation saying he should have felt better after speaking to him and getting it off his chest. Brian responded he was 'sad more than anything'. Laws then shockingly claimed the interview was a waste of 'both of their time.' Former Hey Dad star Sarah Monahan wants Brian to know that he is not alone and people do care . Brian continued to open up about his years spent in isolation after the attacks, trying to minimise human contact when Laws thought it prudent to offer Brian some more sound advice. 'Have you ever stopped and asked yourself, why don't people like me? But this is not the first time, laws has been met with controversy. In 2013, he referred to women who dressed provocatively as 'rape bait' 'You're not the happiest soul, I don't know that you'd make people who are around you feel all that good. Have you tried to brighten up a little? Difficult I know. 'Do you hear me? But you're not taking any notice. 'You've got to be responsible for your own activity. You must make the move, go and talk to somebody about it. 'But don't be down all the time, don't be a wet blanket all the time. Try and have a laugh. 'Go to the pub and have a lemonade for God's sake. He was met with silence. 'No? Well there's not a lot more I can do, is there?' To wrap up the uncomfortable ten minute conversation Laws asked Brian to thank him for his time. 'Brian, could you say thank you?' The interview draws shocking parallels to a conversation Laws had with a female caller in 2013 who had also experienced sexual abuse. Laws blamed the victim and claimed that women who dressed provocatively were 'rape bait'. Twitter has erupted in support for Brian as listeners call for the so-called radio magnate to be sacked. Sarah Monahan, the former co-star of Hey Dad! who was among actor Robert Hughes\u2019 child sex abuse victims, chimed into show support for Brian and said she hopes he can see that there are people out there who do care. She added Laws needs 'genuine help' after listening to the insensitive call.\n",

        "input": "Millions of male workers who leave their rural homes to work in large cities can only have sex with their wives for a fortnight every year. At least 47 million women live in rural China while their husbands work away - leaving them desperate for intimacy when they return. 'All I can think of when returning home for Chinese New Year is sex,' one migrant claimed. And now a series of photographs, taken in Shangnan County in Shaanxi Province, has captured the moment many of these migrants return to their own bedrooms. Wang Libao (right) and wife Zhu Chunlian (left):\u00a0When Mr Wang is away, his wife and children sleep on a 1.5-metre-wide bed. But when he\u2019s home, the two children are sent to stay with grandparents . Wang Libao, 34, and his 30-year-old wife, Zhu Chunlian, got married in 2003, according to a report by\u00a0People\u2019s Daily.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0. Mr Wang works in a gold mine in Lingbao, Henan Province, in central China. He said that because he does not visit his wife in their three-bedroom house very often their two children are sent to stay with grandparents when he returns. Although he has been back for a few days, Mrs Wang said she is already trying to persuade her husband to stay for three more. Wu Maojiang (left) and wife Wang Xiaojing: Mr Wu says he spends about 20 days with his wife every year . Similarly Wu Maojiang, 36, only gets to spent 20 days with his wife Wang Xiaojing a year. The couple got married in 2006 and have a daughter, 8, and a five-year-old son. In 2013, Mr Wu spent \u00a536,000 (\u00a33,820) buying a five-bedroom house for his family. But as Mr Wu has works away, including in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Henan provinces in central China, it is his father who lives with his wife and children. Jiang Quanbao (right) and wife:\u00a0In order to support the entire family, Mr Jiang has been working even though he is very sick . But for some couples it is not just working away that prevents sex. Work injuries are also common as migrants choose to take on dangerous, but high-paid, jobs such as coal mining. Jiang Quanbao, 45, works at different coal and gold mines. He does not get to spend much time with his wife, who he married five years ago. A few years ago Mr Jiang was suffering from back pain when his body collapsed. The doctors told him he had kidney stones and would require surgery. Mr Jiang said he and his wife now don\u2019t have sex life because of his poor health. Qiao Chengfeng (right) and wife Zhang Juan (left): Mr Qiao, who got pneumoconiosis from long-time mining, cannot go out for work any more. Due to health, he has not had sex with his wife for two years . Qiao Chengfeng used to work at different mines. He is suffering from pneumoconiosis and doesn't have the strength to lift a bag of rice. The 31-year-old said although he sleeps with his wife Zhang Juan, 27, every day on the same bed, he has not been able to have sex with her for two years. On hearing this, his wife, who he married in 2005, turns around to weep. Jiang Kun (left) and wife: Mr Jiang and his late father are both miners. He has decided to stay at home for two more weeks in order to spend time with family . Jiang Kun, 31, who is also a miner, said the reason many men spend so much time away from home is because it is not possible to feed the whole family by working in a nearby factory. He added that this decision was made despite many men being aware of the dangers of coal mining. Mr Jiang\u2019s wife is two years younger than him. The two have a nine-year-old son and a seven-year-old daughter. He said he decided to return to work after the Lantern Festival, the fifteenth day after Chinese New Year, because he wants to spend more time with his family. Huang Jiao (left) with her daughter and mother in law their house. Ms Huang's husband left home in central China on the eighth day of Chinese New Year to return to his factory in southern China . But it is not just couples who have been together for years that are affected. Huang Jiao, 26, got married around six months ago. Her husband works in an electronic factory in Guangdong in southern China and earns some \u00a53,000 (\u00a3318) every month. Ms Huang said every year she only has opportunity to \u2018be with my husband\u2019 for a handful of days \u2013 the same applies for most of her female neighbours. Zhu Xianshun (left), whose wife died 14 years ago, is taking care of his paralysed mother-in-law. He has given up the idea of re-marrying .

The Prime Minister's office had said Tuesday that Lee, 91, who is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, had an infection and was being treated with antibiotics. \"Mr Lee Kuan Yew remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further,\" the office said in its latest update. Later Wednesday, a top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax a report that Singapore's founding father had died. A message about Lee's supposed demise, purporting to be from the current Prime Minister, had circulated online. \"We have reported this to the police and they are investigating this hoax. Our website was not hacked, it was a doctored image,\" Farah Rahim, senior director for the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information said. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. Lee was succeeded as prime minister by Goh Chok Tong in 1990, before Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong took power in August 2004. The elder Lee has been credited with Singapore's remarkable transformation from a colonial trading post to a prosperous financial center. However, he has also been a divisive figure, attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents.\n",

        "input": "Looking lean and healthy and sporting something of a George Clooney look, Darren Clarke signed on for his first official engagement as Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup captain. There are 550 days to go before Clarke takes his golfing monument men to Minnesota to try to bring back the trophy \u2014 and many of those days will be filled with the sort of media engagements that occupied his time at the Sofitel at Heathrow\u2019s Terminal Five. No doubt Clarke may struggle for something to say on occasion but that was not the case here as he spoke about Rory McIlroy and other pertinent matters, including one surprising comment regarding the Ryder Cup. Darren Clarke will captain Europe at next year's Ryder Cup in\u00a0Minneapolis . The former Open champion holds aloft the trophy on his first official appointment as captain . After the comprehensive win at Gleneagles last time in 2014, the overwhelming temptation must be to keep everything the same but Clarke is considering one small change to the blueprint. He plans to study the data on wildcards in the tournament before deciding whether to recommend cutting their number from three to two. Of course, there are arguments both ways. He might leave himself short of options if too many of the top players fail to qualify automatically but there is an equally compelling case for saying the man finishing in 10th spot deserves to make the team by right. Even this far out Clarke is unequivocal, however, about who will be the team leader \u2014 it just has to be McIlroy. Clarke has known the 25-year-old Ulsterman since before McIlroy was even a teenager. \u2018Rory always was special as a kid and a golfer,\u2019 said Clarke. \u2018He was different from everyone else and still is.\u2019 Clarke has backed his compatriot Rory McIlroy to complete his grand slam of all four majors . The world No 1 travels to Augusta in a fortnight needing only the Masters to complete his set . The skipper is excited to see how McIlroy fares at the Masters next month but is adamant about one thing: Rory will complete the career Grand Slam one day. \u2018If he doesn\u2019t win it this year, he will win it next year,\u2019 he said. \u2018He\u2019s just too good not to win it, with all his gifts and on a course made for his game.\u2019 What sort of captain will Clarke be? Given his emotional personality, it is hardly surprising he picks out the Ryder Cup ships run by Ian Woos-nam and Sam Torrance. \u2018Sam once said to me that playing in the Ryder Cup is like having your first child, that you really can\u2019t describe it until you\u2019ve gone through it, and that\u2019s always stuck with me,\u2019 he said. \u2018I was fortunate enough to experience the pressure of contending for a major and coming through to win, but for me the pressure of the Ryder Cup was far greater. \u2018And I will be a player-friendly captain. Some might think I\u2019m too close to the players but I will not shirk my responsibilities.\u2019 Clarke is keen to foster that community feeling that marked Paul McGinley\u2019s team in 2014 and one or two earlier incarnations. \u2018It was interesting seeing that from the outside at Gleneagles,\u2019 he said. \u2018I was working for Sky but that togetherness was still so easy to see and clearly so beneficial.\u2019 Players celebrate with former captain Paul McGinley after winning the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles last year . Clarke had a well-publicised falling out with McGinley but, thankfully, both are keen to present a united public front. \u2018Of course I will be taking up his offer to talk with him,\u2019 said Clarke. \u2018Paul couldn\u2019t have done a better job so it would be foolish not to talk. I intend to speak to all the captains. How can that not be a help?\u2019 The first day in a new job can often be a nervous one but Clarke was composed and confident, and enjoyed some light-hearted football banter. After Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s motivational talk at Glen- eagles, would Clarke the Liverpool fan ask keen golfer Steven Gerrard to speak in Minneapolis, given he will be playing in America by then? \u2018After yesterday, what a time to ask me that!\u2019 he said. What price Tiger Woods pulling out of the Masters next week just as he did last year? Whatever happens, it is guaranteed already to be another sad landmark in his startling fall from grace. Now down to 96th in the world, Woods is certain next Monday to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since October 13, 1996. Tiger Woods is set to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since October 1996 . \u2018I have a dislocated shoulder and it has been keeping me out of the gym, which is disappointing. I want to stay fit because . . . well, I shall be old one of these days.\u2019 Arnold Palmer holding court as tournament host last week. Now 85, the great man promised that not even a dislocated shoulder would prevent him from hitting the ceremonial first tee shot at the Masters. In the words of the old Bob Dylan song, may he stay forever young. Arnold Palmer (right) presents\u00a0Matt Every with the trophy after winning the Invitational in Orlando . There is a fine line separating Paul Casey in 49th place in the world rankings from Marc Warren in 51st but right now it is making a huge difference. One is heading to the Masters in a fortnight\u2019s time while the other is not. That could all change, however, following the Valero Texas Open this week. Anyone inside the top 50 after this event will get an invitation to Augusta and while Warren has secured a prized sponsor\u2019s invitation, Casey has decided to stay at home in Arizona. Paul Casey will be sweating on Marc Warren's performance at the Texas Open to find his Masters fate . What price Scotsman Warren, on a straight-shooter\u2019s course that ought to suit his eye, tipping the Englishman out of the field for the season\u2019s first major? It is to be hoped that both scrape in. Under the ranking system, Casey is actually projected to move up a spot without taking the week\u2019s events into account (proceedings at the Trophee Hassan in Morocco on the European Tour could also influence matters). So not just Warren but two other players would have to go past Casey to deny him a Masters outing. As for Warren, anything resembling the tied-17th finish he achieved in his last start at Miami\u2019s Cadillac Championship would do the trick. Among those who could also force their way to Augusta via their efforts in Morocco are Englishmen Andy Sullivan (61st) and Tommy Fleetwood (66th).\n",

        "input": "England may have thrashed Lithuania to take another step along the road to France 2016 but success has certainly not been confined to the senior team this week. When the Three Lions teams are put together from under 17 level upwards, they have won 11 matches out of 11 during this international spell, scoring 27 goals in the process. The under 21s won 1-0 away to the Czech Republic in a friendly on Friday, while the under 20s have beaten Mexico on penalties after a 1-1 draw and seen off the United States 2-1. England's team from under 17 to senior standard have won all 11 matches played this week . England's under 19s have won the first two of their European Championship qualifiers - 3-2 against Denmark and 1-0 against Azerbaijan, meaning they must defeat France on Tuesday to get through. The under 18s got on a roll against Switzerland, winning 1-0 and 6-1 in a double-header of friendlies, and the under 17s won all three of their European Championship qualifiers - against Norway, Slovenia and Romania. So, on the evidence of the past few days, a bright future awaits for the England team. Here, Sportsmail looks at some of the players to have performed well at each age group. UNDER 17 . Ike Ugbo . Age: 16 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward . Chelsea frontman Ugbo has set his sights on emulating club-mate Dominic Solanke by helping England's under 17s to European glory. Solanke played a key role as John Peacock's side lifted the trophy in Malta last year and Ugbo scored twice against Romania at Burton on Thursday to ensure England made this year's finals in Bulgaria with a 100 per cent record. 'It would be a dream come true for me,' said the Chelsea under 18 player afterwards. 'Seeing them win it last year, with Dom doing as well as he did too, it would be great to be able to follow on from them.' Chelsea frontman Ike Ugbo shoots for goal during England under 17's win over Norway last week . Reece Oxford . Age: 16 Club: West Ham Position: Centre-back . Proudly wearing the captain's armband, Oxford headed home to set the Young Lions on their way to a 3-1 win over Slovenia in the second of their Elite Round qualifiers. Despite being just 16, Oxford has featured regularly in West Ham's under 21 side and is tipped for a very bright future. Indeed, the teenager, who made Sam Allardyce's first-team squad for the Capital One Cup tie with Sheffield United earlier in the season, has been the subject of interest from Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United. Reece Oxford celebrates scoring for the under 17s against Slovenia in last week's qualifier . Danny Collinge . Age: 16 Club: Stuttgart Position: Centre-back . Scorer in England's 3-1 win over Norway, the first of the three qualifiers, Collinge has been a mainstay of the under 17 team for some time. He is something of a novelty in that he belongs to Stuttgart's academy in Germany, having joined them last summer from MK Dons. Reflecting on his goal against Norway, he said: 'I was over the moon - it was just being in the right place at the right time. But my celebration was a bit poor, that needs some work for next time.' Danny Collinge runs away in celebration after scoring his first England goal against Norway . UNDER 18 . Adam Armstrong . Age: 18 Club: Newcastle United Position: Forward . A pep-talk from England captain Wayne Rooney proved a source of inspiration for Newcastle hotshot Armstrong, who took his Three Lions goal tally to an impressive 19 in 24 matches with three goals in the friendly double-header with Switzerland over the weekend. Having scored the winner in Thursday's behind-closed-doors match at St George's Park, he contributed two stunners in a 6-1 rout of the same opponents at Walsall on Saturday. Already involved in Newcastle's first team, he has made 14 appearances for his hometown club and was also part of the England squad that won the Under 17 European Championships last season. Newcastle United hotshot Adam Armstrong scored twice in the under 18's friendly against Switzerland . Tammy Abraham . Age: 17 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward . Abraham was delighted to get off the mark on the international stage after scoring twice in the 6-1 defeat of Switzerland on Saturday but it was merely the continuation of an excellent season. He is the leading goalscorer nationally at under 18 level with 21 and has also played a key role in the Blues run to the FA Youth Cup final. He will now compete with club-mate Dominic Solanke and Armstrong for an England starting spot. Abraham said: 'I just have to keep scoring. That's the aim of any striker. I'll keep working hard to be picked again, and I'll be doing my best to achieve.' Chelsea's Tammy Abraham scores England's third goal against Switzerland at Walsall on Saturday . Taylor Moore . Age: 17 Club: Lens Position: Centre-back . Another Englishman abroad, defender Moore signed a three-year professional deal with French club Lens late last year. Capable of playing in central midfield as well as defence, the 17-year-old has become a regular in Neil Dewsnip's under 18 side this season. He too was part of the under 17s squad that tasted European glory in Malta last year, converting a penalty during the shoot-out win over Holland in the final. Taylor Moore on the ball during the under 18's emphatic 6-1 win over Switzerland on Saturday . UNDER 19 . Ashley Smith-Brown . Age: 18 Club: Manchester City Position: Defender . It's been quite the week for Manchester-born Smith-Brown, who scored vital winning goals in the under 19's qualifiers against Denmark and Azerbaijan, keeping Sean O'Driscoll's team on course for the finals in Greece. Primarily a right-back, Smith-Brown is more than capable of playing in any defensive position and has been involved with City's under 21 side this season, as well as the UEFA Youth League squad that reached the quarter-finals. Ashley Smith-Brown of Manchester City pictured in the colours of England . Patrick Roberts . Age: 18 Club: Fulham Position: Winger . A key component of the under 17 team that lifted the European Championships last year, Fulham whizzkid Roberts has quickly advanced to the under 19 level and looks very much at home. Indeed, in the initial qualifying phase he scored four goals and set up four more. Roberts made his Premier League debut last season and has continued to play for Fulham following their relegation to the Championship. Roberts has scored four goals for England during the current qualification campaign . Izzy Brown . Age: 18 Club: Chelsea Position: Forward/winger . Another member of the England team that triumphed at the Under 17 European Championships, the prolific Brown has made the step-up to the under 19 standard effortlessly and scored in the 3-2 win over Denmark last week. He is already a member of Jose Mourinho's first-team squad but features mainly in the Blues under 21 squad and the under 19 team that has reached the last four of the UEFA Youth League. Izzy Brown celebrates scoring for England against Italy in an under 19 international at Rotherham . UNDER 20 . John Swift . Age: 19 Club: Chelsea Position: Central midfield . An accomplished central midfield player, Swift has worked his way up the England youth ladder from the under 16s and is now a central cog in Aidy Boothroyd's under 20s. He opened the scoring in Sunday's 2-1 win over the United States in Plymouth. Brought through the Chelsea academy, Swift is currently out on loan at League One club Swindon Town to gain experience and has impressed, scoring two goals in 10 matches as they push for promotion. John Swift in action for the England under 20s in their 2-1 win over the United States in Plymouth . Moses Odubajo . Age: 21 Club: Brentford Position: Right-back . Brentford's Odubajo was called into the under 20 squad by coach Aidy Boothroyd for the first time and impressed in both matches to suggest that future appearances in the Three Lions shirt may be on the cards. The 21-year-old has been important in Brentford's surprising push for Premier League promotion this season and made the transition to the international arena effortlessly, putting himself in the frame for a place in Gareth Southgate's under 21 squad for the summer's European Championships. Moses Odubajo delivers a cross during England's under 20 win over the United States on Sunday . Alex Mowatt . Age: 20 Club: Leeds United Position: Midfield . This was Mowatt's second appearance in the colours of England and he made a strong case for future inclusion with a good performance in the win over the United States. His form in that match compliments his good season for Leeds United in the Championship, where he has made 31 appearances in all competitions and become a mainstay of the side. Leeds United star Alex Mowatt on the ball for the under 20s in their win over the United States . UNDER 21 . Tom Carroll . Age: 22 Club: Swansea City on loan from Tottenham Hotspur Position: Midfielder . Scored the winning goal as England under 21s defeated the Czech Republic, host nation of this summer's European Championships, on Friday night. The midfielder has been a part of Gareth Southgate's squad for some time and has been playing for Swansea City during this campaign on loan from Spurs. Tom Carroll celebrates with a clenched fist after scoring England's winner against the Czech Republic . John Stones . Age: 20 Club: Everton Position: Defender . A player who has experience with the senior team but seems content to gain experience with the under 21s for the time being. He figured in the win over the Czech Republic and looks set to be included in the squad for the Euros in the summer. Still only 20, Stones is a regular fixture in the Everton defence and manager Roberto Martinez has tipped him for a bright future for both club and country. Stones pictured in training ahead of England's under 21 game with the Czech Republic . Matt Targett . Age: 19 Club: Southampton Position: Left-back . Another product of Southampton's prolific production line, Targett made the jump up to under 21 standard on Friday night having previously played for the under 19s and under 20s. It has also been a breakthrough season for the 19-year-old at club level, with Ronald Koeman playing him in 12 Saints matches this term. Matt Targett made his debut for the under 21s in the win over the Czech Republic .\n",

Robbie Williamson, 11, had been about to reach the end of the pipe stretching over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Burnley, Lancashire, when he slipped and hit his head on the canal banking. Knocked unconscious by the blow, he fell backwards into the water and although a passer-by, alerted by the screams of Robbie's friends, was able to pull him from the canal\u00a0he died a short time later in hospital. Robbie Williamson, 11, drowned in a canal after slipping while playing a game of dare and walking along a gas pipe, as his father and grandfather had done when they were children, an inquest heard . Robbie had been about to reach the end of this pipe, which stretches over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Burnley, Lancashire, when he slipped and hit his head on the canal banking . The Edwardian pipe, which was fitted in 1903, had remained\u00a0exposed to danger from children's pranks for more than 110 years despite maintenance work being carried out three times between 2001 and 2006. Protective iron shields on either side of the pipe were finally installed by National Grid 24 hours after the tragedy on April 22 last year to stop children attempting a similar challenge. An inquest at Burnley Coroner's Court was told that Robbie and his two friends had finished their lessons at\u00a0Shuttleworth High School and had been on their way to meet others at a nearby cricket club. But on their way they spotted a gap in the railings of the Dugdale Bridge and climbed through to the pipe crossing. Robbie's father described him as\u00a0'an absolutely brilliant child' and that since his passing his house had been 'extremely quiet without him' The inquest was told it was a well known dare among school children to see if they could walk across the raised cast iron pipe in order to get to the other side of the canal. 'When they got towards the bridge there were some railings,' Detective Constable Wendy Rothwell of Lancashire Police told the hearing. 'It's believed one said there was a gap in the railings and climbed through. It was sometimes a dare to see if they could walk across. The three boys decided to walk across, there was a conversation who will go first. 'Listening to the children it seems to be a dare possibly between children.' She told the inquest that Robbie went second and he and one of the friends walked with their backs to the wall as they made their way across. 'There were rivets on the pipe which they had to step over and the boys spoke of the pipe being 'a bit slippy.' The officer added: 'As they approached the far end of the bridge one said that he is about to climb down onto the opposite ledge and hears a shout from Robbie and he falls into the water. He strikes himself on the bank of the canal before falling backwards into the water.' Robbie's father, Dean Williamson, and his stepmother Clare lay flowers at the scene following his death . More members of Robbie's family pay their respects to the 11-year-old, who died in April last year . The boys then climbed down and on seeing Robbie in the water screamed for help, as one ran to find assistance. Peter Graham, who heard the children's' pleas said: 'I could see a body lying face down in the canal. I jumped in. I grabbed the child and said, \"help me get him out\".' He added that Robbie had appeared 'lifeless', with his eyes closed, and did not appear to be breathing. As he waited for paramedics to arrive, Mr Graham began CPR and Robbie was then taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital. He was placed in a medically induced coma but suffered a cardiac arrest and died later that night. Tests showed he died from drowning and a head injury. The Edwardian pipe, which was fitted in 1903, had remained exposed to danger from children's pranks for more than 110 years despite maintenance work being carried out three times between 2001 and 2006 . These protective iron shields on either side of the pipe were finally installed by National Grid 24 hours after the tragedy on April 22 last year to stop children attempting as similar challenge . Robbie's father Dean Williamson told the inquest that as a child he had crossed the pipe, as had his own father, but he did not know Robbie had been scaling it. He told the inquest that had he known of his son's activities he would have 'told him off'. 'I didn't want him to do it, obviously if I'd found out I would have really told him off,' Mr Williamson said. He added that despite the iron shield being installed, children could still jump down onto the pipe. 'That shield that they have put on, you can still climb round,' he said. 'Why can't they slope the pipe so there would be no climbing at all, there would be no access. If sloped you have no chance to get onto it. You can still drop onto it.' Tributes left at the scene where Robbie died . In a statement read to the court, Mr Williamson described his son as 'an absolutely brilliant child' and that since his passing his house had been, 'extremely quiet without him'. He added that Robbie had 'absolutely loved life' and had been an outdoors type of child. Year 7 pupil Robbie had only started at his secondary school the day before his death. Representatives from the National Grid said they had believed that the pipe had been underground and was not aware that it was in fact exposed until after the accident - despite work being carried out at the location in 2001, 2004 and 2006. 'Some of our crossings have contact details around the site, this one didn't,' said National Grid's engineering policy manager Ian Aldridge. 'You wouldn't have known who to contact.' The inquest was told there had been no complaints about the pipe to Health and Safety or the National Grid. Coroner Mr Richard Taylor recorded a conclusion of accidental death said he would be contacting other gas and utility companies to report the incident in order to prevent similar tragedies. He added: 'There may be exposed, raised pipe works for which you are responsible either attached to bridges or otherwise, that are accessible to members of the public.' 'The loss of a child is the hardest to bear. We who have heard the evidence today can't possibly appreciate your grief, we can only share it with you. After the inquest Ruth Trippier, speaking on behalf of Robbie's family, said: 'Today has been a great ordeal for them and understandably it hasn't actually allayed any other disquiet about the circumstances that led to the accident. They are glad that National Grid are now, albeit too late for Robbie, taking steps to prevent it from happening again. These unguarded pipe crossings are just an accident waiting to happen.' National Grid said: 'We have installed protection on the pipe over Dugdale Bridge and have carried out a thorough review of all the other pipe crossings we own to see if there is a need for additional measures to be taken to prevent access. We will share details of our review with the wider gas industry. 'Our investigations found we had no record of anyone contacting us or our predecessor companies to report an issue with children climbing on this pipe.'\n",

Governor Scott Walker once envisioned a world where the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally could embark on a path to citizenship. But now the Wisconsin Republican calls that position 'amnesty' and says his view has changed. 'I don't believe in amnesty,' Walker told Fox News\u00a0Sunday. 'My view has changed. I'm flat out saying it. Candidates can say that.' Walker, who emerged this past week in the top tier of potential candidates for the Republican presidential nomination for 2016, says the U.S. needs to secure the border and ultimately put in place 'a legal immigration system that works.' That means, in part, putting the onus on employers and getting them the tools to do that, like E-Verify, an existing federal program that allows businesses to check the immigration status of new hires, Walker said. Walker told the Wausau, Wisconsin, Daily Herald newspaper in 2013 that 'it makes sense' when he was asked whether he could see a world where 'those people' could get citizenship, with the right penalties, waiting periods and requirements in place. At the time, he supported a bipartisan approach to overhauling immigration, with people waiting to get citizenship having priority and others having a legal pathway to live here legally. Walker also said Sunday that President Barack Obama or 'anybody else who is willing to put their name on the ballot certainly has to have the love for country to do that.' Walker drew criticism last month after former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani questioned Obama's patriotism during a speech at a Walker fundraiser. When asked about the former mayor's comments, Walker sidestepped the question by saying he hadn't asked Obama about his love of country.\n",

An academy school is now accepting pupils from birth after launching a 'cradle to university' scheme to help youngsters get ahead. The Northumberland Church of England Academy (NCEA) in Ashington, Northumberland, is only the second school in the country to offer childcare for newborn babies. It was a government initiative first adopted by St Bede Academy in Bolton, Greater Manchester, to help tackle issues in early years, including speech and language acquisition. The scheme, known as childminder agencies (CMA) and set up by the Department for Education in September last year, also helps self-employed childminders find work. Childminders will volunteer with the school and in return receiving training and business advice, while parents are offered affordable childminding in a home environment. Headteacher at NCEA, Andrew Day, said: 'We want to be able to do the best for every single child and believe that having children from cradle to university is the best way to do this. 'Up to 50 per cent of our children starting school have speech and language acquisition issues and we hope that this will help address such issues. 'Evidence suggests that educational outcome is set from the age of two for the vast majority of children. 'We are working in partnership with our parents, we want to change the\u00a0outcomes for our children.' Mr Day, who oversees a school of more than 2,400 students, added:\u00a0'Often our parents come as single parents, with jobs and are busy. We need to take the pressure and burden off them. 'It's not about patronising people, it's about giving them an extra layer of support. The Northumberland Church of England Academy (pictured) has launched the government and Ofsted-approved scheme, known as childminder agencies or CMA to help children with their transition to nursery . 'They will be cared for by childminders in a home environment, but we will work with parents and childminders to ensure that each child can be the best that they can be.' CMA is self-funded by the school, which then charges childminders a fee when they register and also to the parents who use their services. The academy, which caters for pupils up to the age of 19, has a centre for children with profound and severe learning difficulties. It also recently opened three new early years centres offering 120 free nursery places for eligible two-year-olds. Clare Lishman, the academy's director of early years, said: 'This is an exciting expansion to our early years provision. 'Research shows that it is the quality of the provision, whether it is in a nursery setting or with a childminder, that delivers the best long term benefits for a child's development. 'Rapid development takes place between the ages zero and three and investing in early years provision is vital to equip children with the skills they need to start their education. Childminders will volunteer with the school and in return receiving training and business advice, while parents are offered affordable childminding in a home environment . 'Childminders who join the agency will receive lots of support from the academy and be part of the early years provision in the school.' The Ofsted-approved scheme was first piloted in the summer 2013 with 20 organisations nationwide, including primary schools, nurseries and councils. St Bede Academy was the only school to continue the trial at the end of last year. Headteacher, Jack Hatch, said at the time: 'Achieving our goal of being the first CMA to be registered in the UK means a lot to our childcare organisation. 'It should help to provide more of our families with excellent-quality affordable childcare and give even more flexibility than we can offer at the present time.'\n",

The dress that Nyong'o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar last year for \"Twelve Years a Slave,\" reported stolen Wednesday from her room in the swanky London Hotel off Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Yes, that old thing. The L.A. Sheriff's Department got a tip Friday and looked in an abandoned bathroom on the second floor of the same London Hotel, the department said in a press release. The tip, they said, came from \"a media representative\" who got a call from an anonymous caller. The investigators went to the hotel and found a black garment bag underneath the bathroom counter. Inside the bag they found a white dress \"resembling the one\" worn by Nyong'o. Sounds like it would be hard to mistake the dress, but the sheriff's department is working with the dress owners to find out if it's the real thing. Calvin Klein also expressed guarded enthusiasm over the dress's potential return. \"All of us at Calvin Klein are thrilled to know that the dress has potentially been located. This was an amazing collaboration between the brand and Lupita and the dress looked truly exquisite on her,\" Francisco Costa, Women's Creative Director of Calvin Klein Collection, said in a press release. \"Once it's returned to us, we will be able to have the dress restored and archived, as it now represents an important moment for the brand.\" CNN's Deborah Doft and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.\n",

        "input": "Lt. Col. Robert Hite, one of the three remaining Doolittle Raiders, died after a battle with Alzheimer's disease on Sunday, aged 95 . One of the last surviving Doolittle Raiders who attacked Japan during a daring World War II mission has died, age 95. Lt. Col. Robert Hite died on Sunday at a nursing home in Nashville after a battle with Alzheimer's disease. He was one of three remaining Doolittle Raiders. Hite was a co-pilot of a crew that flew one of the 16 B-25 bombers that raided Tokyo in April 1942. Led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, the mission saw 80 airmen sent in bombers from a carrier at sea to attack military targets in Japan. Without enough fuel to reach a safe landing point, the brave crew had to land in China and hope villagers would lead them to safety. Though the attack only caused scattered damage, it's credited with boosting morale in the United States while shaking Japan's confidence less than five months after the country attacked Pearl Harbor. Tom Casey, a manager for the Doolittle Raiders, said that, despite the risks, 'they all volunteered to go anyway.' The 16 B-25 bombers, each carrying five men, dropped bombs on targets such as factory areas and military installations. Prisoner: Hite, shown here being led blindfolded by his captors, was was taken captive by the Japanese for 40 months after the Doolittle Raid . Veteran: After being liberated in 1945, Hite continued his active-duty service in 1951 during the Korean War. He served until 1955 . They then headed to designated airfields in mainland China realizing that they would run out of fuel, according to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. Three crew members died as Raiders bailed out or crash-landed their planes in China, but most were helped to safety by Chinese villagers and soldiers. Of the eight Raiders captured by Japanese soldiers, three were executed and another died in captivity, according to Northwest Florida Daily News. Hite was one of the men that was taken by the Japanese and was held captive for 40 months. Take off: Though the air raid only caused scattered damage, it's believed that it boosted American morale and shattered Japan's confidence . Risky: Without enough fuel to reach a safe landing point, the brave crew had to land in China and hope villagers would lead them to safety . After being liberated by American troops in 1945, he returned to active duty six years later, in 1951 During the Korean War. He served until 1955. Hite's son, Wallace Hite, told\u00a0Fox News that his father would want to be remembered for being patriotic. 'I think he would want two things: that's the attitude we ought to have about our country, and the second is, he was doing his job,' he said. After Hite's passing, there are only two surviving Raiders: Lt. Col. Richard 'Dick' Cole and Staff Sgt. David Thatcher. On April 18, the 73rd anniversary of the raid, the Raiders will present the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force with a Congressional Gold Medal they will be honored with earlier in the week. Ambitious: Led by Lt. Col. James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, the mission saw 80 airmen sent in B-25 bombers from a carrier at sea to attack military targets in Japan . Leader: Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle (pictured above) led the 80 airmen on the daring raid on Tokyo during World War II . The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on 18 April 1942, was an air raid by the United States during World War II. The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, caused negligible material damage to Japan, but helped to boost a wounded nation's morale in the aftermath of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. US Army Air Forces B-25B Mitchell medium bombers, with five crewmen on each were launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, took off from the aircraft carrier on less than 500 feet of runway. They had only enough fuel to drop their bombs on military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety. Pilots volunteered and trained in Florida for what they only knew was 'extremely hazardous.' Navigator Griffin, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, got top-secret briefings with pilot David Jones in Washington, just five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Once at sea, the rest learned targets - factories, plants, military facilities on mainland Japan. They knew the uncertainties: what if the Navy task force was attacked? What defences would they face? And with B-25s unable to land on a carrier decks, could they reach friendly bases in China? Aircraft: The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, B-25B Mitchell medium bomber launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific . The Raiders brushed aside Doolittle's assurances that anyone was free to withdraw. After encountering Japanese patrols, the raid launched ahead of plan, some 200 miles farther from shore for fuel-stretched bombers. Doolittle's plane took off first at 08:20 from a pitching carrier deck. They flew low in radio silence, skimming seas and then treetops. Cole recalls the country song 'Wabash Cannonball' running through his head. He tapped his foot in time until Doolittle shot him a questioning look. They were greeted by anti-aircraft guns and puffs of black smoke. Flak shook planes. When they arrived at the target, Col. Doolittle ordered to open up the bomb bay doors. The bombs dropped, and the raiders 'got the heck out of there.' The danger was just beginning. All 16 planes lacked enough fuel to reach bases and either crash-landed or ditched in dark, rough weather along China's coast south of Shanghai. They narrowly stayed ahead of Japanese searchers, who killed villagers suspected of helping the Americans. Eight Raiders were captured, and three executed. A fourth died in captivity. Three had died off the coast of China. In the end, fourteen crews, except for one crewman, returned either to the United States or to American forces. Bird's eye view: The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, would fly over military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety .\n",

You would never know to meet Autumn Byas, from Bass Hill in southwest Sydney, that she was born with a congenital deformity because her confidence and lust for life is oozing out of the energetic little girl. The adorable little girl may only be able to hear from her left ear but that doesn't doesn't stop her great love for music and dancing. But her mother, Tanya Byas, has been on a mission since her daughter was born with microtia to get to California for Autumn to have an operation because she can't have surgery in Australia until she is 10 years old - in seven years' time. Autumn Byas, from Bass Hill in southwest Sydney, was born without a right ear due to a\u00a0congenital deformity . Her mother, Tanya Byas (right), has been on a mission to get to California for her daughter to have an operation because Autumn can not have surgery in Australia for another seven years until she is 10-years-old . Autumn loves music despite being deaf in her right ear . The condition, that affects about one baby in every 8,000-10,000 births, is treated differently in Australia with medical professionals using rib cartilage from the 10 year-old patient to recreate the ear, which takes six months to recreate. However in America, the surgical technique uses a synthetic framework and the body\u2019s own tissue to create an ear during the eight-hour operation, meaing there are no age restrictions. 'They will use her good ear as a template and make it out of synthetic material but make it a bit bigger because ears only grow a little bit so when she grows up they will be even and they use her membrane skin to cover it,' Tanya explained. Autumn will also need a jaw reconstruction when she is about 12 or 13 years old. After scrimping, saving and fundraising, Tanya has booked her daughter in for the operation on June 2 but she is $20,000 short with just 10 weeks to go. Although Autumn is deaf in her right ear, she speaks well and has no other health complications but her mother's worst fear is that she will be tormented when she starts school in two year's time for looking different. You would never know to meet Autumn that she was born with a congenital deformity because her confidence and lust for life is oozing out of the energetic little girl - pictured at her dance class . 'With school and bullying the way it is at the moment - life is hard enough,'\u00a0Tanya Byas said. 'She is so outgoing and free-spirited - it doesn't hold her back - she just goes about everyday life and I don't want that to change.' Paul Stanley from KISS was born with the same condition and was teased at school, and although it didn't stop the guitarist from succeeding in one of the most famous rock bands in the world, he still went ahead and had the reconstructive surgery in 1982 - almost a decade after the band formed. 'I read that he got called things like a \"one-eared freak\" when he was at school and I don't want Autumn to get called that,' she said. 'As much as I can teach her to be strong - it would still be tough.' Tanya's fear is that her daughter will be bullied when she starts school in another two years . A fundraiser is being held on Saturday to help with the last $20,000 needed for the $50,000 surgery . Life has been tough for Tanya, 39, who works full time as a sales coordinator, while her parents look after Autumn and has done without so she can put as much as she can towards her daughter's surgery. When Autumn was one-year-old, Tanya held a fundraiser dinner which raised $17,000 and she has managed to save $13,000 of her own money. She has also managed to pay for airfares and accommodation for the month-long trip. 'It's been hard because we can't do everyday things that people take for granted like going out to lunch or taking a trip,' she said. 'We went to the zoo last month but only because our friends had a free family pass.' But, Autumn still gets to do fun activities like any other kid such as swimming and dancing lessons which she relishes. The condition, Microtia, affects about one baby in every 8,000-10,000 births . With still $20,000 to go, Tanya is holding another fundraiser dinner this Saturday in the hope to raise the last of the funds for the surgery. 'I haven't even thought about what I will do if we don't raise the funds - I will have to get it from somewhere even if I get out a loan I guess,' she said. 'It will change Autumn's life immensely - it will give her a good start in life because no one will ever know.' 'She's such a performer so this will help her if she chooses that path in life.'

After being transferred from Bali to Nusakambangan on Wednesday, Chan and Sukumaran are being held in semi-isolation cells in Besi prison on the island. It's where the men will spend at least ten days, with preparations for their execution having been delayed. Scroll down for video .

Myuran Sukumaran's mother Raji (right) and sister Brintha (centre) on the tarmac at Yogyakarta, the closest main airport to the port town of Cilacap to which they will drive on Thursday afternoon . Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja tried to visit Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman on the island of Nusakambangan . Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has not signalled their 72-hours notice period has begun. 'About notification, it's a minimum three days before the execution,' he said. 'It could be 10 days.' His comments come after President Joko Widodo reportedly told an al-Jazeera reporter off camera that the executions would not be this week. Mr Joko on Thursday responded to a prisoner swap arrangement floated by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in her last push to save Chan and Sukumaran from the firing squad. The president laughed when asked about a swap arrangement. 'No way,' he said. He was determined that Chan and Sukumaran be executed. 'Look at how many die, our young generation,' he said, referring to victims of drugs. 'We have to look at the future.' In contrast to their group cells at Kerobokan jail in Bali, the men now have a cell each but with little in it other than a toilet and tiny washing area. They reportedly are allowed an hour outside their cells in a secured exercise area and have been medically checked since their arrival. They have been talking through the prison cell walls with another death row inmate, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, who was also transferred to Nusakambangan on Wednesday, although without the massive display of force for the Australians. It is not known whether Chan and Sukumaran's families - who were due to arrive in the island's port town of Cilacap on Thursday - will be able to visit the men on Friday, when visits are usually banned. Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja - who Chan considers family - told Daily Mail Australia prison officers would not allow him to see the Australians when he went to Nusakambangan on Thursday.

'They are still in isolation, they wouldn't let me visit them. No one can visit them,' he said. The last time Mirdjaja spoke to Chan was on Tuesday afternoon, just hours before he was moved from Kerobokan. 'Andrew said he wanted to be in the company of his family and he said I am his family,' Mirdjaja said. 'Myuran asked me to help with his exhibition at the Hard Rock Hotel on Saturday.' Mirdjaja said he would be staying at Cilacap for 'a few days' in the hopes that he would be granted access to see Chan and Sukuraman. 'I can't describe how I feel. It's really, really bad. It's really hard for me,' Mirdjaja said. This is Nirbaya, also known as 'Death Valley', the place where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will likely be taken for their executions . It is located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells . It is not known how the prisoners destined for execution will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan . The Australians' newest cellmate Raheem Salami, convicted on trafficking 5.3kg of heroin through Surabaya airport in East Java in 1998, was transferred to Nusakambangan from a prison in that region. Chan, Sukumaran and Salami are now occupying three of the four cells in Besi prison where they are allowed a small amount of clothes, Chan his Bible and virtually nothing else. They are expected to be transferred to Batu or 'stone' prison on the island and into a complete isolation area at least 72 hours before the announced execution date. There are a total of 10 death row drug dealers slated to be executed simultaneously, Chan, Sukumaran, an Indonesian, a Filipino woman and six other male foreigners. This weather beaten hut in Nirbaya or Death Valley sits near the sport where foreign drug smugglers were executed in January and where the Australian Bali Nine duo may be taken soon and put to the firing squad . The jungle and rainforest of Nuskambangan prison island looms over the Barracuda armoured personnel van carrying Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as they arrive off the police boat on Wednesday . Shackled and handcuffed, Andrew Chan cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Kerobokan prison . Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in Central Java . Indonesia is already under fire over their practice of the death penalty but pictures of a smiling police commissioner posing with the Bali Nine duo has landed them in more hot water. Djoko Hariutomo was seen posing with the pair before their plane takes off on the two-hour flight to Cilacap. The police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar had his hand on Andrew Chan's back and smiling for the camera. He appeared in a second photograph with his hand on the shoulder of Sukumaran who was captured gazing up at the officer. This is the exterior of Batu prison on Nuskambangan island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold the Australians . Sodong port (above) on Nusakambangan Island was the dropping off point on Wednesday for the Australian Bali Nine duo before being taken by road on to the prison where they are currently being held in isolation . Chan and Sukuraman are expected to face a firing squad in an area known locally as 'Death Valley', a lush green clearing amid citrus orchards and banana palms. The spot is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan, which is also known as 'Death Island', and it is the place where just under seven weeks ago the Indonesian Government executed five drug smugglers. And this place, up a winding dirt track just 3km from where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells, is likely to soon be their last place on earth. Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south.\n",

It's not equal to the ratio of any two whole numbers, so an approximation -- 22/7 -- is used in many calculations. Pi is essential in architecture and construction and was used frequently by early astronomers. Pi has been known for about 4,000 years, but it started to be called by the Greek letter only in the 1700s. The origin of Pi Day . Pi Day started 27 years ago at San Francisco's Exploratorium. Physicist Larry Shaw, who worked in the electronics group at the museum, started celebrating pi on March 14, 1988, primarily with museum staffers. The tradition has grown to embrace math enthusiasts from all walks of life. Celebrations .

State senator Ernie Chambers, a liberal-leaning independent from North Omaha, was speaking in Nebraska's unicameral capitol building when he said, 'My ISIS is the police.' The chamber was discussing a bill that would allow concealed weapons to be carried in bars when Chambers, 77, began talking about police violence and comparing law enforcement to extremists. Scroll down for video . Ernie Chambers, 77, a Democrat from North Omaha, said during a debate about a gun control measure that 'My ISIS are the police' (file photo) The state senator (above, in blue shirt) responded to statements from colleague Tommy Garrett (inset) that residents were afraid of ISIS by criticizing police and comparing them to the terrorist group . Senator Tommy Garrett, a sponsor of the bill, said that the measure was necessary because residents of Nebraska were afraid of terrorist groups, according to The\u00a0Omaha\u00a0World Herald. 'Nobody from ISIS ever terrorized us as a people as the police do daily,' Chambers said. 'The police are licensed to kill us,' he said. 'My home is not threatened by ISIS, mine is threatened by the police.' The senator, who is African-American, described instances of seeing police brutality against blacks. Though the liberal legislator said that he was a nonviolent person, he added that he would carry a weapon against police. 'If I carried a gun, I would want to shoot [a police officer] first and then ask questions later like they say the cop ought to do.' Members of the legislature spent hours criticizing the statements this week after they were picked up by conservative talk radio. Chambers caused further controversy when he was speaking about police and said, 'If I carried a gun, I would want to shoot him first and then ask questions later like they say the cop ought to do' (file photo) The legislator has faced numerous calls for an apology or resignation, including from US Representative from Nebraska Jeff Fortenberry (pictured, file photo) State Sen David Schnoor called for Chambers to resign, according to Watchdog.org.

        "input": "(CNN)Robert Durst's wife mysteriously disappeared decades ago. It's an unsolved case that hasn't stopped haunting him. Years after she went missing, prosecutors argued Durst was hiding out from investigators digging into that case when he killed a neighbor, dismembered the body and skipped town. Jurors acquitted him in a high-profile 2003 murder trial after his lawyers said he'd acted in self-defense. Now the 71-year-old millionaire real estate heir from one of New York's wealthiest families is behind bars, accused of murder again in another case that some say is tied to his wife's disappearance. FBI agents arrested Durst Saturday night in New Orleans. Investigators say they believe he was behind the 2000 slaying of Susan Berman, a crime writer and Durst's longtime friend, who was shot dead in her Beverly Hills home. \"As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death,\" Los Angeles Police said in a statement Sunday. Police, who described him as a \"cold case murder suspect,\" didn't specify what new evidence pointed them toward Durst. The arrest comes amid heightened interest in the eccentric heir, who's now the focus of the HBO documentary series \"The Jinx,\" which explores whether he had any connection to his wife's disappearance and investigators' suspicions that Berman was killed because she knew what happened to her. Durst has long maintained he didn't kill Berman or have anything to do with his wife's disappearance. Investigators found him Saturday at the JW Marriott hotel in New Orleans, where he was staying under a false name and was carrying a fake driver's license, according to a law enforcement official who's been briefed on the case. He'd paid in cash, and authorities believe he was preparing to leave the country and flee to Cuba, the official said. He was jailed without bond and was awaiting an extradition hearing Monday morning. \"We will waive extradition and get to Los Angeles as soon as possible to answer the charges,\" Chip Lewis, Durst's lawyer, told CNN on Sunday. Durst's brother said in a written statement that he was thankful for the arrest. \"We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst,\" Douglas Durst said. \"We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.\" Accusations about what Robert Durst has done depend on who you ask. His one-time wife, Kathie Durst, went missing in 1982. No one has been charged in her disappearance. And according to The New York Times, she's been declared legally dead. Robert Durst has said the last time he saw her was when he dropped her off at a train station in Westchester, New York, so she could head back to medical school in the city. He secretly divorced her in 1990, Court TV reported. Her family has said Robert Durst is to blame for her disappearance and hailed his arrest over the weekend as a sign they could be close to getting answers. \"The dominoes of justice are now starting to fall,\" Jim McCormack, her brother, said on Sunday. \"Through our faith, hope and prayers the last domino will bring closure and justice for Kathie.\" This isn't Durst's first run-in with the law. In 2003, he admitted he'd killed and dismembered Morris Black, his neighbor in Galveston, Texas, but argued he'd shot Black in self-defense during a struggle. Prosecutors argued he'd planned Black's killing in order to steal his identity and escape the attention of New York investigators looking into his wife's disappearance. Durst testified that he hid out in Galveston and posed as a mute woman because he was afraid as he faced increasing scrutiny in the case, Court TV reported at the time. \"It seemed to me the big problem was Robert Durst,\" he said, referring to himself in the third-person. \"I wanted to not be Robert Durst.\" Durst is an heir to a fortune thanks to his family's New York City real estate investments. The Durst Organization was founded by his grandfather and is now run by his brother and cousin. After a civil lawsuit in 2006, Robert Durst cut ties with his family and 10 Manhattan skyscrapers in return for a $65 million settlement, The New York Times reported. In 2000, his friend and longtime confidant, Susan Berman, was killed in her California home. The killing, CNN's sister network HLN reported in 2012, occurred just after police reopened the investigation into Kathleen Durst's disappearance. \"She was a confidante of Robert Durst. She knew him well. They knew each other and were very, very close,\" CNN's Jean Casarez said. \"And it was just days before investigators were to fly out to California to talk with her about what she may have known about the disappearance of Kathleen Durst that she was shot execution-style in her living room.\" For years, speculation has swirled about who could be responsible for Berman's death. She'd written books about her family's mafia ties and explored the history of Las Vegas, and some suspected she might have drawn the ire of a killer through her work. Investigators in the past homed in on one key piece of evidence: a postcard sent to authorities that tipped them off that Berman's body was inside her home. A police handwriting analysis said the writing on that card looked like Durst's, author Miles Corwin told CNN in 2004. But Corwin, who shadowed investigators working on the case as part of his book \"Homicide Special: A Year With the LAPD's Elite Detective Unit,\" said at the time that police didn't have enough evidence to charge Durst in the killing. \"They don't have enough to arrest him,\" Corwin said in 2004. What's changed since then? In \"The Jinx,\" Berman's stepson reveals a letter from Durst he found among her possessions. That could be a key development, said Michael Daly, a special correspondent for The Daily Beast. \"You look at the letter, and the handwriting is astonishingly similar,\" Daly said. The Los Angeles County district attorney reopened the Berman homicide investigation last week. Investigators haven't said whether the documentary series played a role in this weekend's arrest. HBO, which is owned by CNN's parent company Time Warner, praised the series' director and producer in a statement Sunday. \"Years in the making, their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in Robert Durst's story with the public and law enforcement,\" HBO said. CNN's Jack Hannah, Kyung Lah, Carma Hassan, Shelby Lin Erdman and Linh Tran contributed to this report.\n",

There were people who wrote us off but we're alive and kicking. People will look at that result but the performance was great,' he said, with Villa three points clear of the drop zone. It was a tense affair throughout the 90 minutes and Sherwood appeared to show every kind of emotion . Benteke scored in the league for the first time since December and Sherwood admitted the striker had told him exactly what he would do with a penalty. He said: 'Goalscorers are there to be shot down and it takes a brave man to stand up there. I asked him before the game if he gets a penalty what he was going to do.

        "input": "Why and how certain types of mushrooms glow has long confused scientists, but now they think they might have an answer. It appears that some fungi emit light to attract insects at night, which then spread their fungal spores around. And interestingly, the mushrooms are also able to sync up their ability with the circadian clock, so they only become bioluminescent when it is dark. Scientists in Brazil studied why certain species of mushroom glow. They found the ability helps them attract insects at night. These creatures will then move their fungal spores elsewhere. But the mushrooms are able to turn off the ability during the day. Pictured is\u00a0Neonothopanus gardneri . The research, published in the journal Current Biology, was led by the University of Sao Paulo. Among bioluminescent organisms, fungi are the most rare and least understood. Of more than 100,000 species of fungi, only 71 are known to produce green light, a process that uses oxygen and energy. Scientists had thought they produce light around the clock as byproduct of their metabolism, but based on new evidence it seems that isn't so. The effect is triggered by a chemical reaction between luciferin, a light-emitting pigment, and the enzyme luciferase. It can occur in fungi as well as in a range of animals including jellyfish, squid, scorpions and other insects. In fact, the mushrooms' glow appears to be under the control of a temperature-compensated circadian clock. This level of control helps them 'save energy' during hours of daylight when they do not need to grow. At night, the green glow attracts insects including beetles, flies, wasps and ants. 'It appears that fungi make light so they are noticed by insects who can help the fungus colonize new habitats,' said Dr Cassius Stevani of Brazil's Instituto de Qu\u00edmica-Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. The circadian control of bioluminescence makes the process more efficient. 'Regulation implies an adaptive function for bioluminescence,' added Dr Jay Dunlap of Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine. Here the species Neonothopanus gardneri is seen during the day, when its bioluminescent ability 'turns off' in order to conserve energy.\u00a0Scientists had thought they produce light around the clock as byproduct of their metabolism, but based on this new evidence it seems that isn't so . To make the findings, the researchers made sticky, fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green LED lights (shown).\u00a0When those pretend fungi were placed in the forest , the ones that were lit led many more insects to get stuck than did comparably sticky dark mushrooms . The research focused on Neonothopanus gardneri, one of the biggest and brightest of bioluminescent mushrooms. N. gardneri is also called 'flor de coco,' meaning coconut flower, by locals in Brazil, where the mushroom can be found attached to leaves at the base of young palm trees in coconut forests. Other fungi have other methods to disperse their spores like the Common Stinkhorn (shown), which releases a foul smell to get flies to attract flies . To make the findings, the researchers made sticky, fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green LED lights. When those pretend fungi were placed in the forest where the real bioluminescent mushrooms are found, the ones that were lit led many more insects to get stuck than did comparably sticky dark mushrooms. The team are now hoping to identify the genes responsible for the mushrooms' bioluminescence, and aims to explore their interaction with the circadian clock that controls them. They are also using infrared cameras to watch the interaction between N. gardneri mushrooms and arthropods, especially larger ones, more closely. And the findings could also reveal how mushrooms are dispersed by insects, which is important because N. gardneri plays a key role in forest ecosystems. 'Without them, cellulose would be stuck in its form, which would impact the whole carbon cycle on Earth,' said Dr Stevani. 'I dare to say that life on Earth depends on organisms like these.' Some fungi in the group known as basidiomycetes, including two bioluminescent mushrooms, are also parasites of coffee and pine trees. As a result, Stevani says, 'it is very important to know how basidiomycetes grow and consequently how they spread their spores.'\n",

But the good deed didn't impress 69-year-old Larry Myers, who lives next door to the woman. He grabbed his snowblower and started blowing snow back towards Immke as he cleared it up.

Myers complained to Eastlake Police, but they say they are now investigating him for a misdemeanor charge of assault.

        "input": "(CNN)Wednesday's terrorist attack, which killed 23 people, hit Tunisia where it hurt by targeting its flourishing tourism industry. The deadly attack on the prominent Bardo Museum near Tunisia's parliament in the country's capital, Tunis, is the latest instance of an armed assault carried out by gunmen willing to fight to the death, a tactic that has been widely adopted by jihadist terrorists in recent years, including in North Africa. Such attacks mimic the 2008 Mumbai assaults in which 10 gunmen from Pakistan went on a rampage in the massive Indian port city. They took hostages and killed more than 160 people over a three-day period, in an attack that drew sustained global TV coverage. The gunmen attacked iconic Mumbai targets such as the Taj hotel, which is frequented by Westerners. The Mumbai gunmen embarked on their attack knowing that it was a \"fedayeen\" mission -- meaning \"those who sacrifice themselves\" -- and that they would probably fight to the death. Only one gunman survived. In this week's Tunisia attack, the gunmen took hostages, two gunmen died in the assault, and three survived and are being hunted by the Tunisian government. Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid said the attackers at the Bardo Museum had specifically targeted tourists to hurt the country's economy. This seems a likely outcome of the attack, as tourism is vital to Tunisia's economy, providing 15% of GDP. Tunisia is also the only country where the Arab Spring produced a successful, lasting democratic transition, making it attractive to tourists who are avoiding going to countries like Egypt, which did not weather the Arab Spring as well as Tunisia. Already, some tour companies are canceling excursions to Tunis. In January, in Tunisia's neighbor Libya, the local branch of ISIS mounted a similar attack on the upscale Corinthia Hotel in the capital, Tripoli. Two gunmen, one of them a Tunisian, killed 10 people, including an American. Both gunmen died in the attack. This attack served ISIS' purposes of sowing greater instability in Libya and expunging Western influence from the country, as the hotel was where many foreign businessmen stayed. A senior US official told one of us that the U.S. intelligence community estimates that jihadist terrorist groups such as ISIS now control a twelfth of the landmass of Libya, which is one of the largest countries on the African continent. This is a sobering finding for Tunisia, which had been largely immune from the kinds of terrorist attacks that have recently plagued Libya and other North African countries. While the museum attack in Tunisia and the hotel attack in Libya may help terrorist groups to achieve their strategic goals, more often than not, armed assaults by terrorists against so-called soft targets such as hotels, supermarkets and malls do not achieve much beyond the tactical successes of global news coverage and causing mayhem. In September 2013, Al-Shabaab, the Somali al Qaeda affiliate, killed 67 people in a fedayeen-style armed assault on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya. Four gunmen carried out the attack, which unspooled over a four-day period. The Westgate attack received much global news coverage and was designed to put pressure on the Kenyan government, which had sent troops to Somalia to fight Al-Shabaab. However, a year and a half after the attack on the mall, Al-Shabaab continues to lose territory in Somalia, and the Kenyan military has continued to battle the terrorist group. The plague of Mumbai-style armed assaults by jihadist terrorists is not confined to Africa. In January, Mumbai-style tactics were used in Paris when Cherif and Said Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly conducted armed assaults on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket over a three-day period. All three gunmen were killed. In a videotape, Coulibaly said ISIS inspired him. The Paris attacks received considerable coverage around the world but had no impact on France's willingness to continue its involvement in coalition airstrikes against ISIS.\n",

The study by the government\u2019s aid watchdog warns that a \u00a352 million programme to help strengthen Bangladesh\u2019s security services could have been used to target opponents of the regime. British aid money was used to train detectives in tracking mobile phones and analysing call data \u2013 skills which researchers warned could be used to \u2018monitor and suppress political opposition groups\u2019 in the country where corruption is endemic. A report claims British aid money\u00a0may have been used to help corrupt regimes stamp out political opposition. Pictured: Police stand guard following demonstrations in the Democratic Republic of Congo . The Department for International Development (Dfid) initially said the officers involved were not involved in political activity. But when the Independent Commission on Aid Impact warned it would go public on its concerns, the project was scrapped. Dfid last night insisted there was \u2018no evidence\u2019 that funding had been misused. The commission\u2019s report reveals that Dfid also funded training for the Bangladeshi police in taking fingerprints - including fingerprinting 40,000 convicted prisoners. But researchers questioned the value of the scheme in a country where fingerprint evidence is not admissible in court. The new study raised widespread concerns about the use of British aid to help so-called fragile states strengthen their police and security services. In Sudan, a programme to strengthen local police had to be abandoned in 2013 amid concerns about police brutality towards street children. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) a similar programme was scrapped last year after a United Nations report accused the Congolese national police of involvement in illegal killings. Today\u2019s study gives the overall programme its second-lowest \u2018amber-red\u2019 rating, meaning that it is performing \u2018relatively poorly\u2019, with \u2018significant improvements\u2019 needed to achieve value for money. The report acknowledges the importance of trying to improve policing in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, where corruption and police brutality are often rife. The study by the government\u2019s aid watchdog warns that a \u00a352 million programme to help strengthen Bangladesh\u2019s security services could have been used to target opponents of the regime . But it says that Dfid\u2019s projects are \u2018not making enough of a difference to the lives of the poor\u2019. Watchdog chief Graham Ward said a \u2018significant rethink\u2019 was now needed to make the projects \u2018more realistic and effective\u2019. The study was scathing about a project to build \u2018model police stations\u2019 in a range of countries, including Nigeria, Bangladesh, Malawi, Sri Lanka and the DRC. The initiative was meant to raise standards by establishing beacons of good policing. The new \u2018model\u2019 stations were given extra cash for training and equipment. In Bangladesh, 15 of the new police stations were built. But the report finds that \u2018perceptions of police performance are, by most measures, worse in model police stations than the national average\u2019. The proportion of people saying they have been the victim of crime increased by 48 per cent in the period, while the proportion forced to pay bribes to police officers more than trebled. The study found there was \u2018little evidence\u2019 of improvement in police standards in Nigeria and the DRC \u2013 and warned that the model police stations were too expensive to ever be replicated across the country. However, the study did find some evidence that Dfid projects were helping reduce crime against women and girls in some countries. Dfid last night defended its strategy of investing in police and security forces. A spokesman said there was \u2018no evidence\u2019 that funding in Bangladesh had supported police repression of political dissidents. The spokesman said the project had been dropped following a \u2018risk review\u2019. She also defended the fingerprinting project, which she said would aid the detection of crime and reduce the reliance on forced confessions. She added: \u2018Security and justice are the most challenging sectors we work in and Dfid focuses on countries with the biggest potential for improvement. We have made good process particularly in helping women and girls gain access to justice, but where concerns about human rights and instability become too high, we have no hesitation in shutting programmes down.\u2019 But Labour said the report showed ministers had \u2018no strategy\u2019 for dealing with the issues.\n",

The former imperial residence is offering history buffs the chance to spend the night in a former suite of an emperor from just\u00a0\u20ac1,400 a night (\u00a31,000). The opportunity for a unique overnight stay in the 1,441-room palace will undoubtedly prove popular, as the museum is one of the nation's most-visited tourist attractions. Scroll down for video . The historical Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria, has just opened its doors for overnight guests in the former emperor's suite . The suite that will be available for guests to rent offers two opulent bedrooms, a salon, kitchen and two bathrooms, and was once home to\u00a0Emperor Franz Joseph's private chambers, according to GoUnusual.com, which has listed the property. Guests in the top-floor suite will also have access to their own private cook, limousine service and butler during their stay. 'At the end of the 17th century Emperor Leopold I commissioned the gifted Baroque architect Bernhard Fischer von Erlach to built a palatial hunting lodge for the heir to the throne,' a spokesperson for the palace said. 'On the site of the old imperial ch\u00e2teau de plaisance a splendid edifice was to arise. 'Half a century later under Maria Theresa, Schonbrunn Palace was to become the magnificent focus of court life. 'From that time onwards it played host to the leading statesmen of Europe.' The stunning estate boasts 1,441 rooms and is currently one of the nation's most-visited tourist attractions . Those booking in for an overnight stay will have access to a suite with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a salon and a kitchen . Guests staying on the property will also have access to their own private cook, limousine service and butler during their stay . The property has long hosted top international statesmen, including US President John F Kennedy in 1961 . A great deal has changed in Austria today, with the country now a republic, but Schonbrunn Palace has remained a place where high-level political meetings still occur. 'The magnificent architecture and the exquisite decor of its state rooms marks Schonbrunn out as a cultural treasure and tourist attraction of the first order,' the spokesperson said. 'In an imperial setting, guests can wine and dine like an emperor and bed down like a princess.' The property was first purchased in 1569 by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II to serve as a recreational hunting ground. The palace got the name Schonbrunn, which means 'beautiful spring', thanks to an artesian well on the grounds. Schonbrunn Palace was first built and remodelled between 1740 and 1750, during the reign of Maria Theresa, who had received it as a wedding gift. Franz I redecorated the estate in its now-signature neoclassical style. Franz Joseph, a former Austrian emperor, spent a great deal of time at Schonbrunn until his death in 1916. When the Habsburg Monarchy fell in 1918, the newly-founded Austrian Republic took control of the property and turned it into a museum. After World War II, the palace served as offices for British military officers, before being turned into a museum once again in 1955. Since the mid-1950s, it's been a major tourist attraction and the location of some important historical events, such as a meeting between US President John F Kennedy and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1961. In 1996, UNESCO inducted the Schonbrunn Palace onto the World Heritage List. Although the Baroque decor is remarkable in its own right, these sweeping panoramic views might be the palace's best feature . A spokesperson for the palace said: 'In an imperial setting, guests can wine and dine like an emperor and bed down like a princess' During a guest's stay in the palace, all services will be provided by the nearby Austria Trend Parkhotel Schonbrunn . Since the 1950s, the property has been a museum, and in 1996, UNESCO inducted the Schonbrunn Palace onto the World Heritage List . From the suite, the Gloriette, Neptune Fountain, the Kronprinzengarten and the palace park are visible, sprawled across 400 acres . The project is unique for Europe and can be booked in partnership with Austria Trend Hotels. During a guest's stay in the palace, all services will be provided by the nearby Austria Trend Parkhotel\u00a0Schonbrunn, which itself used to function as the emperor's guest house.

Ofsted would not confirm how the child came to be left behind but their report states they issued 'compliance action'.

Teresa Erickson, 52, and her husband Dale, 59, were driving their pickup in the opposite direction when they were unable to avoid the hay. Mr Erickson's car was forced into a ditch and burst into flames. Killed: Dale Erickson, 59, and Teresa Erickson, 52, died within days of each other after their vehicle crashed into a ditch on County Road 9 and caught fire on Saturday morning after they were hit by a bale of hay . Scene of the crash: The couple passed the truck carrying the hay along a curve on Houston County Road 9 northeast of Houston, Minnesota just after 9 a.m. on Saturday . The couple were airlifted to hospital in Wisconsin however Mrs Erickson died soon after the accident and her husband passed away earlier this week. The semi that caused the crash was driven by Randall Hongerholt, 49, of Houston, according to the state patrol. He was not injured but according to the Minnesota State Patrol, charges are pending following the outcome of an investigation into the crash. 'Commercial vehicles, and all vehicles, are required to secure their load in a manner that prevents any of it's load from dropping, shifting, leaking, blowing or otherwise escaping from the vehicle,' said Patrol Lt. Tiffani Nielson. 'This fatal crash, unfortunately, is exactly why we have these laws in place \u2014 to prevent injuries or death. 'This was a very tragic crash, and a family is grieving a terrible loss that could have been prevented.' Hay bales vary greatly in weight, depending not only on dimensions but density. A federal study analyzed seven deaths in Minnesota in the mid-1990s associated with large hay bales and found that the bales ranged from 750 to 1,500 pounds. In Minnesota, truckers can be fined $385 if they are found to have an improperly secured or shifting load.\n",

        "input": "(CNN)Hillary Clinton's lawyerly news conference Tuesday, at which she doggedly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server to conduct official State Department business was improper, might extinguish the matter for most Americans -- but it doesn't get Clinton out of the woods politically. The real possibility of lasting political damage to the former secretary of state will come if her emails reveal any favoritism to any of the foreign donors who contributed to the welter of powerful charitable organizations housed at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This is the multibillion-dollar foundation Hillary Clinton leads alongside ex-President Bill Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea. What we already know about the foundation's donors is controversial: Some of the corporations, banks and foreign governments that have funded foundation projects have abysmal human rights records and have been involved in everything from drug money laundering to aiding terrorism in violation of American law. The Clintons can make a plausible case that it's best to solicit money from companies and foreign governments -- even ethically challenged ones -- and put it to good use attacking problems of global poverty. As Bill Clinton recently told reporters: \"You've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.\" It's an interesting and important debate, and most Americans would probably approve the idea of putting \"bad\" money to good use. But the argument only works if Clinton's work as secretary of state was completely separate from the foundation's tip-toeing around ethical challenges. To figure that out requires analyzing the history of what began as the William J. Clinton Foundation shortly after he left office in 2001. Different initiatives were added over the years to combat AIDS, climate change, poverty and other ills; the most high-profile of these projects, the Clinton Global Initiative, added in 2005, brings world leaders together to tackle the world's problems. To make things even more complicated, the foundation's website says its mission is supported by the Clinton Presidential Center in Arkansas, which includes an archive of the President's papers. The foundation recently co-sponsored a Black History month event with the center. The foundation's thicket of relationships with corporate donors and foreign heads of states is difficult for outsiders to penetrate and understand. And with 350 employees spread across 180 nations, running the foundation is an expensive proposition: in 2012, the various initiatives spent $214 million according to The New York Times but still ended up $8 million in the red. Who gave, and why, is hard to figure out. According to The Wall Street Journal, \"The Clinton Foundation does disclose its donors, which isn't required by law. But the disclosure is limited; dates and exact amount of the donations aren't disclosed. Donations are listed in value ranges and updated annually with only the previous year's donor getting an asterisk by his or her name.\" Hillary and Bill Clinton have put some safeguards in place to put distance between her job as secretary of state and the inner workings of the foundation. During Hillary Clinton's years as secretary of state, the high-profile Clinton Global Initiative split off from the larger Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton says he had no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. Hillary Clinton also stayed away from the foundation during her time at the State Department and agreed to subject possible conflicts to the department's ethics office. It was only after she resigned that she formally joined the foundation and added her name to its title. Ideally that would settle the matter, but there's the possibility that the elaborate formal safeguards may have been breached or ignored. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that \"at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during her tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation,\" raising questions about whether the firms were using the donations to curry favor with the secretary of state. In one well-publicized case, Hillary pressed a state-owed Russian airline to buy American planes from Boeing. The effort worked: Boeing ended up with a $3.7 billion contract. (To be sure, secretaries of state are always lobbying foreign countries to purchase American products. It's part of their job.) But weeks after Clinton's persuasion (what she called a \"shameless pitch\"), Boeing donated $900,000 to the foundation. A CNN investigation by Alexandra Jaffe recently showed that half a dozen banks that gave money to the Clinton Foundation were involved in ethically questionable behavior and might have used donations to the foundation and/or its CGI spinoff as a way to gain favor with the Clintons and enhance their tarnished reputations. In 2012, the British bank Standard Chartered paid $667 million in fines for violating sanctions against Iran and HSBC paid $1.92 billion to settle claims of illegally doing business for customers in Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Myanmar and allowing drug dealers to launder money through the bank. Both banks have been major contributors to the foundation. As Jaffe notes, \"the fact that the foundation partnered with banks that were actively under investigation raises questions over what restrictions, if any, the foundation placed on its fundraising operation.\" And according to The Washington Post, seven nations donated millions to the foundation during Clinton's time as secretary of state, including a $500,000 gift from Algeria that the foundation failed to clear in advance through the State Department's ethics office. That sort of corner-cutting, and the cozy-seeming connections between Clinton and various corporations and governments, will be tough to explain on the campaign trail. If emails suggest Clinton was aware of the corporations, banks and nations sending money to her foundation during her time at the State Department -- or worse, took action to help encourage the flow of donations -- the issue would almost certainly derail her likely presidential campaign. It's much too early to count Hillary out, of course. The Clintons can credibly argue that the money they collected has funded more than a billion dollars' worth of good works, from lowering the price of HIV-fighting drugs in developing countries to advancing green technology and educating girls and women. But there's no scenario in which voters can be expected to ignore or support the former secretary of state if she is shown to have been simultaneously arranging pay-to-play deals with businesses and governments seeking help or favors from the U.S. government while she was in office. What will matter is not why or how Hillary stored her emails but whether the actual emails show her in ethical quicksand from which no presidential candidate can escape.\n",
        "output": "Errol Louis: Bigger question than kind of email used is whether Hillary Clinton's emails show favoritism for donors . He says some corporations and foreign nation donors stained by sanctions for illegal behavior . Louis: If voters see a quid pro quo from the former secretary of state's emails, it could derail her candidacy .\n"

        "input": "Boris Berezovsky was killed in his bathroom because he was preparing to give Vladimir Putin evidence of a plot involving leading oligarchs to topple the strongman in a coup, it was claimed today. The exiled Russian tycoon was slain by Western secret services linked to the plan to overthrow the Kremlin leader. The theory comes from Berezovsky's former long-time head of security Sergei Sokolov, who disputed the version of British police that the ex-billionaire took his own life, aged 67, in Berkshire in March 2013. Scroll down for video . 'Convinced': Berezovsky's former head of security Sergei Sokolov says he knows his boss did not take his own life - and alleges he was killed by Western secret services over evidence of a plot to overthrow Putin . 'I am convinced it was done by the Western secret services,' he said. 'If Berezovsky's death is a puzzle for you, it is a problem solved for me. Boris was killed simply because he possessed certain secret information and was going to make it public. This is not just my guess, I know it for sure.' Sokolov, the head of a major Moscow private security agency, said his ex-boss was intent on returning to Russia, and had opened negotiations with Putin on allowing him back despite years of bitter opposition to the president. 'Boris forwarded Vladimir Putin a letter with repentance,' he said. Deceased: Boris Berezovsky, left, was found dead at his ex-wife's home in Berkshire in March 2013. An outspoken critic of Putin, he is said to have sent the Kremlin leader a 'letter of repentance' and was planning his return to Russia . 'It was a part of the big venture he had been planning. Berezovsky was living and looking forward to his return to Russia. Of course, he was hoping for indulgence. 'Boris was killed only because he possessed information which he was going to share with Putin. 'I am absolutely sure that Boris had video and audio evidence about certain oligarchs who offered to organise a coup in the country, promising him to be seen as being at the head of the attack. 'Berezovsky planned to come back to his motherland with this sensational material. 'You understand it now: those people he had gathered compromising materials for, considered him to be a serious threat.' Berezovsky - who had a penchant for secretly recording conversations - had hidden his treasure trove, claimed Sokolov. Allegations: The explosive theory was made by\u00a0Sergei Sokolov, who claimed his former boss had gathered 'compromising material' as part of his plan to return to Russia . 'Western secret services are still chasing it. Boris was not a predictable guy, who would keep precious information under the pillow in his house.' He claimed that Berezovsky had inside information from MI6 about Russia. 'I knew that Boris was in close relations with MI6, Mossad and the CIA,' he claimed. But 'when he became dangerous for their recruited residents such as Russian politicians and oligarchs, the Western secret services decided to get rid of him.' He alleged: 'Berezovsky's murder was prepared for several months. It was a brilliant operation by the secret services. 'You decide: Berezovsky had a house .... round the clock security, CCTV cameras around the house. A fly would not make it. 'And on the day of his death all the security guards vanished, CCTV cameras were switched off for some reason, although they are placed every 100 metres. 'It is likely that not only MI6 took part in this operation but also CIA. There were people around Boris who were recruited by these secret services, including some of his guards.' His personal guard and driver Avi Navam would later find his body in the locked bathroom. He also disputed claims that Berezovsky was impoverished and depressed when he died having lost all his money, following a bitter \u00a33 billion high court battle against Roman Abramovich. Death: Berezovsky was found dead at his ex-wife's home, pictured, in Berkshire in March 2013. 'Let me assure you, Boris was not a poor man. There were rumours after his death that he did not have money for a plane ticket. This is just lie. At the moment of his death he had about $1 billion dollars in his bank accounts. 'One should agree, it is possible to enjoy your life with this money. Yes, he could not afford yachts like Abramovich but, gently speaking, he was not poor.' He also had a string of young lovers, he claimed. 'I knew Boris very well. He was a man with solid mental health. He was full of adrenalin - it was obvious he was about to start a new venture.' 'Not a poor man': \u00a0Berezovsky owed the taxman \u00a346 million when he died, but Sokolov claimed he had about $1 billion in his bank account . Sokolov also claimed that in the 1990s, Berezovsky had ordered him to follow Boris Nemtsov, the Russian opposition leader killed in Moscow on 27 February. He admitted to a Moscow newspaper that he had installed listening equipment in the politician's flat during the Yeltsin era. 'Berezovsky ordered us to follow Nemtsov,' he said. 'We tried to understand what he was interested in, and if he can tell the truth - we followed his movements plus installed recording equipment in his flat. 'Some part of compromising materials Berezovsky showed to Boris Yeltsin, something used for other purposes.' 'Every oligarch or official has a weak side,' he said. 'The best agent is the person who is next to you but you hardly notice him - either a secretary or a driver. It was easy to recruit women.' He told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: 'Nemtsov collected beautiful women. 'When young guys were going out with girl, he was studying, and then he got to the top of this life. And started to compensate it. This where his interest in young women was coming from.' He claimed that Nemtsov could have been killed by a jealous husband. 'But first of all, Western secret services are the beneficiaries of Nemtsov's death.' 'From the point of view how it was planned, it is very much like CIA operation,' he claimed. Despite this, Russian police have identified a Chechen link to the murder. 'It was a simple murder - go up the steps, shoot, jump into a car... and the killers, it does not matter who they are - Ukrainian or Chechen,' said Sokolov. Negotiation: Berezovksy had opened talks with Putin about allowing him to come out of exile and return to Russia . A coroner last year recorded an open verdict at Berezovsky's inquest. Mr Berezovsky, 67, was found with a ligature around his neck. Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford said that 'contradictory' evidence meant he could not prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the businessman either took his own life or was unlawfully killed. Sokolov was head of the Atoll security agency, and worked with Berezovsky from 1994 to 1999. The security specialist has changed his mind on the tycoon's death which he originally saw as suicide. Soon after his body was found, Sokolov said: 'Berezovsky was not a threat to anybody and nobody really needed him. 'His death was quite natural. He did not like sports, he did not care a lot about his health...It is a case like Whitney Houston.'\n",

This follows laws in sixteen US states - including Alaska, California, New Jersey and Texas - explicitly relating to revenge porn. Under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can, in theory, distribute it as they see fit but Twitter's rules additionally considers the people in the footage. It will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission. Twitter said 'agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy', including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders. 'Users who believe that content they post has been incorrectly identified is violating the policy can appeal the decision and agents will review that request as well,' said the firm. 'Content that is identified as violating our policy will be hidden from public view and users posting it will have their accounts locked; those users will be required to delete the content in question before being able to return to the platform. 'Users posting such content with an intent to harass will be subject to suspension from Twitter.' The changes follow reports Twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. This means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details Twitter will be able to intervene. Reports recently claimed Twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. When people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number (pictured). In the future, Twitter may ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number . Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father's suicide. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games. In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the \u00a310 note. Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year. When people sign up to Twitter they are required to provide an email address, which is then validated. Adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive input notifications or setup two-step verification. Under the reported plans, once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and cross-referenced each time a new user signs up to the site. Last month an internal memo sent by Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site 'sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls'. In the memo, Mr Costolo said he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future. Mr Costolo's comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse. In December, a blog post\u00a0titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information.

Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than \u00a32,500. Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls. Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act. Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003. It has also made it simpler to flag tweets and accounts for review. These enhancements similarly improved the reporting process for people who see abuse but aren't directly receiving it. More recently, the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features. Tina Bhatnagar, Twitter's vice president of User Services said: 'Over the last six months, in addition to the product changes, we have overhauled how we review user reports about abuse. 'Overall, we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously, and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports. 'We are also beginning to add several new enforcement actions for use against accounts that violate our rules. These new actions will not be visible to the vast majority of rule-abiding Twitter users - but they give us new options for acting against the accounts that don't follow the rules and serve to discourage behavior that goes against our policies. The safety of our users is extremely important to us. It's something we continue to work hard to improve.' In recent years Twitter has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls. Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father's death. She made an appeal to her followers to report two users on Twitter (shown above)\n",

Fighting intensified to the north and south of Saddam Hussein's hometown yesterday as Iraqi security forces vowed to reach the centre of Tikrit within 48 hours. Video from the village of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, shows all that remains of Hussein's once-lavish tomb are the support columns that held up the roof. Poster-sized pictures of Saddam, which once adorned the mausoleum, are now nowhere to be seen amid the piles of rubble. Scroll down for video . Rubble: An Iraqi soldier inspects the demolished tomb of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein . Destroyed: An Iraqi soldier takes photos of the demolished tomb of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein in Tikrit, 80 miles north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad . Carnage: Video from the village of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, shows all that remains of Hussein's once-lavish tomb are the support columns that supported the roof . Instead of the posters of the executed dictator, Shiite militia flags and photos of militia leaders can be seen throughout the predominantly Sunni village, including that of Major General Qassem Soleimani, the powerful Iranian general advising Iraqi Shiite militias on the battlefield. 'This is one of the areas where IS militants massed the most because Saddam's grave is here,' said Captain Yasser Nu'ma, an official with the Shiite militias, formerly known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. The IS militants, he added, set an ambush by planting bombs around the tomb. ISIS has controlled Tikrit since June, when it waged its lightning offensive that also saw Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, come under their control. The terror group was helped in its conquest of northern Iraq by Saddam loyalists, including military veterans, who appealed to Sunnis who felt victimized by Baghdad's newly Shiite-dominated government. ISIS claimed in August that Saddam's tomb had been completely destroyed, but local officials said that although it was ransacked and burnt, the building suffered only minor damage. Conflict zone: Poster-sized pictures of Saddam, which once covered the mausoleum, are now nowhere to be seen amid the piles of rubble . Clear: Iraqi soldiers inspect the demolished tomb of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein yesterday . Reports: ISIS claimed as long ago as August that Saddam's tomb had been completely destroyed, but local officials said that although it was ransacked and burnt, the building suffered only minor damage . Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in 2003 and was executed by hanging in December 2006 after an Iraqi special tribunal found him guilty of crimes against humanity for the mass killing of Shiites and Kurds. His body has been kept in the mausoleum in his birthplace, Ouja, since 2007. The complex featured a marble octagon at the centre of which a bed of fresh flowers covered the place where his body was buried. The extravagant chandelier at its centre was reminiscent of the extravagant life he led until U.S. forces toppled him in 2003. Iraqi media reported last year that the dictator's body was removed by loyalists amid fears that it would be disturbed in the fighting. Its current location is not known. Iraqi soldiers stand next to the demolished tomb of former Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein yesterday . No entry: An Iraqi soldier stands next to the demolished tomb of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein . Members of Peace Brigades - a Shiite militia group loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr - are seen heading to Tikrit, where Iraqi troops backed by Shiite fighters and Iranian advisers are fighting Islamic State extremists . Recapturing Tikrit, a Sunni bastion on the Tigris River, would pave the way for an assault on Mosul, which U.S. officials have said could come as soon as next month. Concerns are mounting that Iraq's Shiite militias, of which an estimated 20,000 are fighting in Tikrit, will carry out revenge attacks on this and other areas that are home to predominantly Sunni residents. Amnesty International last year said the militias wear military uniforms but operate outside any legal framework and without any official oversight, adding that they are not prosecuted for their crimes. Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch echoed those concerns, calling on the Iraqi government to protect civilians in Tikrit and allow them to flee combat zones. Its statement noted 'numerous atrocities' against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces. Shiite militants are increasingly being accused of levelling the Sunni towns they capture from the Islamic State group, making it impossible for residents to return. Tikrit has already been heavily damaged in months of violence. Members of Peace Brigades sit with their weapons in an armored vehicle as they leave Baghdad for Tikrit . Young volunteer militia posing for pictures before going into battle against Islamic State fighters in Tikrit . Innocent: A boy holds a white flag as he passes through a checkpoint manned by Sunni fighters who have joined Shi'ite militia groups allied with Iraqi forces against the Islamic State . A satellite image of Tikrit, released last month by the United Nations, observed that at least 536 buildings in the city have been affected by the fighting, with at least 137 completely destroyed and 241 severely damaged. Local Sunni tribal fighters have formed uneasy alliances with the Iraqi army and Shiite militias in the battle for Tikrit, which Iraqi and U.S. officials believe is essential for defeating the Sunni militant group. Yazan al-Jubouri, a Sunni from Tikrit fighting alongside the Shiite militias, said that the Islamic State militants killed 16 of his relatives and kept his family living in horror. 'We want to take revenge on those IS militants who killed our children,' he said.\n",

But since his 'Siiii!' war cry in Zurich when he collected the trophy and sent an 'I'm coming for you' message to Lionel Messi, the Real Madrid forward's fortunes have been in free-fall to the extent that the exit door that leads back to Manchester United has been opened once again. Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes told Spanish radio his player would go on scoring goals for Real Madrid until he is 40 as the club and the player's entourage celebrated his well-deserved gong in January. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo sits on the Bernabeu pitch during his side's 2-0 win against Levante . The former Manchester United man endured a frustrating evening despite his side's La Liga victory . Ronaldo has a shot at goal on Sunday night but he was unable to find the back of the net . But since then he has been sent off and banned for two games; chastised by supporters for holding a birthday party through the early hours after a humiliating derby day defeat by Atletico Madrid and pledged a vow of silence after the team's defeat in the Champions League to Schalke. Manchester United have been linked with both a bold move for Gareth Bale or a romantic return for Ronaldo. Sources in Madrid now say of the two moves, it would be a bid for Ronaldo that would meet with less resistance. For all the boos and whistles for Gareth Bale from sections of the Santiago Bernabeu crowd the club president Florentino Perez is firmly behind his \u00a386million signing and sees him as Ronaldo's heir apparent. Ronaldo is even understood to have done more to help the former Tottenham forward as he tries to push his profile and get himself on next year's Ballon d'Or podium. The request was not received with open arms. Much like Bale when he scored twice on Sunday against Levante. Gareth Bale celebrates after opening the scoring but Ronaldo appeared frustrated that he hadn't found the net . Ronaldo celebrates winning the Premier League title with Manchester United shortly before leaving in 2009 . A return to Old Trafford is not out of the question for the Portuguese superstar after a miserable start to 2015 . Real Madrid trio Ronaldo, Bale and Karim Benzema share an embrace after the Welshman's second goal . Bale, pictured with his partner Emma Rhys-Jones, is seen as the heir to Ronaldo by Florentino Perez . Ronaldo failed to celebrate his team-mate's opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring after failing to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the six-yard area. Like the incredible sulk of old, Ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after Bale converted the rebound. Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Ronaldo's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to Bale scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy.' He was also frustrated when Bale scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a Ronaldo shot but enough to divert it past the Levante goalkeeper to wrap up the three points. And with those two goals for Bale and a string of misses from himself in what remained of the game, including one sitter in injury-time and a weak shot from a perfect Bale cross in the first half, Ronaldo went straight down the tunnel at full-time, not to the centre circle to applaud supporters. Ronaldo split up with his long-term girlfriend, Russian model and actress Irina Shayk, in January . Ronaldo's form has dipped since his split and Lionel Messi now has more goals than him this season . Irina accompanied Ronaldo to the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards in January 2014 but she was absent this year . Off the pitch things have gone no better for him with a split from Russian girlfriend Irina Shayk ensuring he has filled the pages of many of Spain's gossip magazines amid speculation about why the couple broke up and who his next partner will be. All this with the Clasico on the horizon \u2013 a match he would never have dreamed he would go in to on fewer goals than Messi who now has two more than his rival. Last year Ronaldo raced to a 12-goal lead over Messi who was struggling for form and fell out spectacularly with his manager Luis Enrique. Messi's relationship with his coach is now on the mend and he has scored 20 goals since the start of the year. Things change so quickly in Spanish football and Ronaldo's last three months are evidence of that. What also may have changed is the possibility that after six extraordinary seasons at the Bernabeu Ronaldo could yet find time in his record-breaking career to go back to Old Trafford for a glorious swansong.

William Mudd resigned Thursday over the emails discovered during the U.S. Department of Justice investigation of racial prejudice in the city's police and judicial system, city spokesman Jeff Small said on Friday, citing the city attorney. The city's top court clerk, Mary Ann Twitty, was fired earlier this week in connection with the emails, Small said. Several employees forwarded the emails but until now none had been disciplined, the report said. Examples of the racist emails include one sent in October 2011 that showed a photo of bare-chested dancing women, apparently in Africa, with the caption \"Michelle Obama's High School Reunion.\" A June 2011 email described a man trying to put his dogs on welfare because the canines were \"mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English and have no ... clue who their Daddies are.\" Some critics have called for the department to be disbanded and for Police Chief Thomas Jackson to resign. In a Friday interview with CNN's Sara Sidner, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said Jackson was not copied on any of the emails. When asked if Jackson and the city manager may be fired, Knowles said, \"We're going to do our due diligence and hold people accountable.\" Knowles also said he doesn't think the department will be disbanded. When asked about what happens next in Ferguson, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday, \"We are prepared to use all the power that we have, all the power that we have to ensure that the situation changes there. And that means everything from working with them to coming up with an entirely new structure.\" When a reporter asked if that included dismantling the police force, Holder replied, \"If that's what's necessary then we are prepared to do that.\" Holder ordered the investigation after a white police officer, Darren Wilson, shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown last summer, setting off months of sometimes violent street protests in the town outside St. Louis. The DOJ declined to bring charges against Wilson, who has since left the force. No state charges were filed either. In a separate report, the Justice Department described what it said was a \"pattern and practice\" of discrimination against African-Americans by the Ferguson police and municipal courts. That discrimination included racist emails. Ferguson is a town of 21,000 that is 67% African-American. Among the findings in the report: . From 2012 to 2014, 85% of people subject to vehicle stops by Ferguson police were African-American, 90% of those who received citations were black, and 93% of people arrested were black. In 88% of the cases in which Ferguson police officers reported using force, it was against African-Americans. From 2012-2014 black drivers were twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during traffic stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband. President Obama said Friday that although he doesn't think the abuses of power in Ferguson are typical of America, there are individuals and possibly whole departments in American law enforcement that may struggle to prevent prejudice in their ranks. \"I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,\" Obama said in an early morning interview on SiriusXM's Urban View channel. \"I think there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement has broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure they are protecting, serving all people, and not just some.\" Knowles has outlined a number of reforms the city implemented to address some of the Justice Department's concerns, and said the city \"must do better\" to address racism. \"We must all work to address issues of racial disparity in all aspects of our society,\" he said Wednesday.

The health and social care course was taught at Solihull Sixth Form College in the West Midlands from September to 36 students whose university places depend on their grade. College bosses have apologised and written to the universities explaining the students are not to blame. The mishap, which was announced via a letter to parents, has outraged the families involved. Teachers at Solihull Sixth Form College, pictured, are holding emergency classes over Easter after health and social care students were taught the wrong syllabus . One mother, who did not wish to be named, said: 'This is a serious error and now they are expecting students to go into college to learn this extra work. 'Some students have booked to go away for Easter. 'They are asking students to forget everything they have learned for the past six months and learn something completely new. 'One student apparently ran out of the class in tears when they were told about this. This is their futures we are talking about. 'There is not enough time to learn a completely new unit of work.' College principal Paul Ashdown said: 'The college takes full responsibility for this mistake and is very sorry for any stress caused to students. 'We have written to all the students affected to apologise and reassure them that we will be working extremely hard to put this right. 'There is time to correct this and our health and social care teachers will be working over the Easter break to ensure students can catch up on the outstanding work. 'As well as delivering this additional teaching, we will also be contacting the universities that all the students affected have offers with. The college apologised for the blunder and reassured affected students . 'We think student success will not be affected, but we will be alerting universities nonetheless to ensure this is taken into account. 'Our focus is to ensure no student is penalised as a result of what has happened.' In the letter to parents, assistant principal Elizabeth Baker said: 'I am extremely sorry to inform you that a serious error has been made by our health and social care team. 'In their efforts to make a more rounded programme, the team chose a set of units which do not fit the examination board's regulations for this qualification and without remedial action none of the students will achieve their A level in health and social care. 'In order to complete the course, students need to complete a new unit. 'We are looking to use as much time as we can before the end of this term but will be seeking to use some time in the Easter holiday. 'We are also aware that many students have university places which are dependent on them achieving their predicted grades both from this qualification and others that they are studying alongside. 'We will write to the universities to explain the error that we have made and ask for them to take into consideration the upheaval and extra work needed to remedy the situation in the light of actual results achieved.' The mix-up follows controversy at the college in January, where it emerged mock exam candidates had been banned from going to the toilet alone amid fears they would use mobile phones to search for answers. Mr Ashdown admitted that decision was extreme but said it was made after students were caught cheating with phones during toilet breaks in last year's exams. The college caters for 2,140 students aged 16-18. It received a 'good' rating at its last Ofsted inspection in 2013.\n",

        "input": "(CNN)A 17-year-old male fatally shot an Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown, targeting him and then continuing to fire as the immigrant rushed to get inside, Dallas police said Friday. Authorities don't believe the suspected shooter knew the victim, Ahmed Al-Jumaili, Dallas Police Maj. Jeff Cotner said reporters, nor do they believe he knew Al-Jumaili's ethnicity. And they haven't given any indication Al-Jumaili had anything to do with what led the teen to head out armed in the first place -- a purported shooting at his girlfriend's apartment, if that in fact happened. Cotner said that, while there have nearby shootings that might be tied to gangs, \"we (have been) unable to substantiate ... whether or not there was an actual shooting at the apartment.\" What police do believe, based on witness testimony and other evidence, is that the teenager shot and killed Al-Jumaili, for whatever reason. \"When he saw Mr. Al-Jumaili and their family, he targeted them, he shot at them with intent,\" Cotner said of the suspect, who is under arrest. \"And as Mr. Al-Jumaili ran back toward his apartment, he tracked him with his rifle and continued to fire.\" Dallas police named the suspected shooter, though CNN is not identifying him yet since he's a minor and it's not clear if he'll be charged as an adult. The teen turns 18 in May, police said. Until the fatal shots ended Al-Jumalli's life, March 4 had been a day of fun and joy for Al-Jumaili and his family. The 36-year-old, who had immigrated to the United States 20 days earlier, joined his brother and wife taking pictures in the parking lot of a Dallas apartment complex amid the snow. \"Just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us,\" Cotner said. Then came the gunshots and Al-Jumaili's cry, \"I'm hit!\" A few hours later, the Iraqi immigrant was dead. Three days later, a Dallas detective found surveillance footage from a nearby elementary school showing four people coming from the apartment complex. The black-and-white soundless surveillance video shows one person apparently carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person seemingly carrying a hand gun, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. Approximately 13 seconds later, another person comes into view and passes by the camera, followed by a fourth individual who is walking, she said. Then, on Tuesday, a witness walked into the Richardson, Texas, police station and provided a nickname of a possible suspect -- Kaca. That nickname eventually led to the 17-year-old police believe shot Al-Jumaili. Investigators interviewed him for the first time Thursday, at which time he denied ever leaving his girlfriend's apartment. Then, authorities got the OK to search his apartment and found an unfired rifle cartridge, Cotner said. The teen was brought to Dallas police headquarters for another interview, and he changed his story. Yes, he had been at the scene of Al-Jumaili's killing. But no, he hadn't done it. Yet that's not what someone who'd been with him said. According to Cotner, this witness said he saw Al-Jumaili taking pictures in the snow, . \"The witness stated that he observed (the suspect) raise the rifle,\" the police major said. \"... The witness then heard one shot, followed by several more.\" Then all of them bolted. The incident caused waves in Dallas' Muslim community. While police haven't given any indication this was a hate crime, though Alia Salem -- executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area -- noted \"a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims.\" Speaking Friday on behalf of Al-Jumaili's family, Salem expressed gratitude to police and others for their work on the case and said \"our community has been at a loss for words and very saddened by this tragic death.\" \"We just want to see justice happen here,\" she said. \"And this is the first step in that.\" CNN's Pat St. Claire and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.\n",

The former pace attack leader of Australia's all-conquering Test team in the early 2000s has habitually forecast thrashings for England in the past, and has been embarrassed when Australia have not performed as he expected, notably in the 2005 series. He played a part in Australia triumphing 5-0 Down Under in 2006-07, and again envisaged the same result in England in 2009, only for Andrew Strauss to lead the home side to their triumph. Glenn McGrath has predicted a 5-0 whitewash for Australia when they travel to England this summer . McGrath was a constant tormentor of England in Ashes series during his playing days . Peter Moores' side have suffered a terrible World Cup but will hope to bounce back in Test cricket . McGrath had more recently refrained from trumpeting Australia as unbeatable by England, even prior to their 5-0 demolition job in 2013-14, but that is how he again positions Michael Clarke's Test team. With England toiling to sorry effect at the World Cup, McGrath is looking to the summer and sees more misery on the cards when ousted limited-overs skipper Alastair Cook returns to take the helm of the five-day team. He told BBC Sport: 'If the Australian team keeps playing as they are, they're going to go to England full of confidence. England were knocked out of the World Cup by Bangladesh last week, and McGrath can't see them improving . During his playing days McGrath made a habit of predicting whitewashes, and was not always proved right . 'I can't see England beating them and I'm more than happy to predict 5-0.' McGrath, 45, expects the World Cup debacle to be followed by change in the England camp. He said: 'I thought they struggled to take wickets or build up any pressure and they didn't look potent at all. 'There are going to be changes, whether it's coaching or the players. A lot of responsibility lies with the players.'\n",

They are also the offensive lineman for the reigning NCAA football champion Ohio State Buckeyes. Being a slob requires a player to be 'mean' and 'nasty', be able to work hard' and 'know how to eat'' like a 'human garbage disposal'. Scroll down for video . Members of the Ohio State Buckeyes offensive line (some pictured) affectionately call themselves 'slobs' Former Buckeye Andrew Norwell, who now plays guard in the NFL for the Panthers, created the name in 2013 .

It's just a group of slobs' Former Buckeye Andrew Norwell, who now plays guard for the Carolina Panthers in the NFL, created the name in 2013, according to The Zone. Norwell came up with nickname while he was drawing pictures in the team's meeting room. Right guard Pat Elflein explained: 'He'd just draw a bunch of goofy pictures and just mash a bunch of animals together. 'He'd just make them look real funny together, and one of them, he made one of them and he called it a slob. 'It was a big, ugly, thing and it just kind of caught on that we're the slobs.' The name caught on and the guys on the team kept using it when Norwell moved on. They will continue to use the affectionate term in the coming season as four out of five of the team's starting offensive lineman will be returning, the\u00a0Columbus Dispatch\u00a0reported. Junior linemen Chase Farris said: 'A slob isn't what you look like, a slob is how you act, it's what you are, it's what you do.' 'We go eat, we slob. When we're together in the meeting room, we slob.

        "input": "A new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases, it has emerged. An official source told The Associated Press that the U.S. Secret Service will conduct drone flights between 1am and 4am over the coming weeks in restricted airspace over Washington D.C. During missions, agents will look at how to interfere with rogue consumer-level drones, which commonly carry video cameras but are powerful enough to carry small amounts of explosives. The challenge for the Secret Service is quickly detecting a rogue drone flying near the White House or the president's location, then within moments either hacking it to seize control over its flight or jamming its signal to send it off course or make it crash. Growing trend: A new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases, it has emerged . The Secret Service has said only that it will openly test drones over Washington, but it declined to provide details such as when it will fly, how many drones, over what parts of the city, for how long and for what purposes. It decided to tell the public in advance about the tests out of concern that people who saw the drones might be alarmed, particularly in the wake of the drones spotted recently over Paris at night. Flying overnight also diminishes the chances that radio jamming would accidentally affect nearby businesses, drivers, pedestrians and tourists. It is illegal under the U.S. Communications Act to sell or use signal jammers except for narrow purposes by government agencies. Depending on a drone's manufacturer and capabilities, its flight-control and video-broadcasting systems commonly use the same common radio frequencies as popular Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies. Jamming by the Secret Service - depending on how powerfully or precisely it works - could disrupt nearby Internet networks or phone conversations until it's turned off. Testing in the real-world environment around the White House would reveal unexpected effects on jamming efforts from nearby buildings, monuments or tall trees. Signals emanating from an inbound drone - such as coming from a video stream back to its pilot - could allow the Secret Service to detect and track it. Federal agencies generally need approval to jam signals from the U.S. telecommunications advisory agency, the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Found: The recreational drone that landed on the White House South Lawn is seen in this U.S. Secret Service handout . That agency declined to tell the AP whether the Secret Service sought permission because it said such requests are not routinely made public. The Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed it formally authorized the Secret Service to fly the drones and granted it a special waiver to fly them over Washington. The agency declined to provide specifics about the secret program. In January, a wayward quadcopter drone, piloted by an off-duty U.S. intelligence employee, landed on the White House lawn. At the time, the Secret Service said the errant landing appeared to be accidental and was not considered a security threat. The agency had been looking at security issues surrounding drones before the January crash, but the crash of that drone led the agency to focus more attention on security issues surrounding small, unmanned aircraft that can be hard to detect. Previously published reports have disclosed that the Secret Service already uses jammers in presidential and vice presidential motorcades to disrupt signals that might detonate hidden remotely triggered improvised explosive devices. The United States Secret Service, in conjunction with other inter-agency partners, will conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems, in the coming days and weeks. Because these exercises will be conducted within the normally flight restricted areas in the Washington D.C. area, they have been carefully planned and will be tightly controlled. In preparation for these exercises the Secret Service has coordinated with all appropriate federal, state and local agencies. Researchers with the Homeland Security Department's science and technology directorate are working on strategies to interdict an unauthorized drone flying inside security areas. The research arm of DHS is trying to balance security concerns of the small, hard-to-detect devices, with the burgeoning commercial use and interests of hobbyists. Likewise, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration said last week it's studying how the U.S. can resolve privacy risks with increasing use of drones. The Homeland Security Department hosted a two-day meeting last month with industry officials, law enforcement and academics to discuss balancing security and commercial interests and establishing security practices. Days later, the Secret Service, which is part of the Homeland Security Department, distributed a three-sentence press release saying it will 'conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems, in the coming days and weeks.' Trying to keep drones out of a secure area can be tricky. There are basically three ways to stop a drone, said Jeremy Gillula, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation: block the radio signals linking the drone to its controller, hack the aircraft's control signals and trick it into believing it is somewhere else, or physically disable it. Some drone manufacturers program a 'geo fence' - location coordinates their drones treat as off-limits and refuse to fly past - into the drone's programming. Police could physically knock a drone out of the air with a projectile or use a net to catch it. 'If it were me that would actually be the first thing I would think about doing,' Gillula said. 'You would have to basically encase the White House in this net. It sure wouldn't look pretty, but in some ways it would be the most effective way.'\n",

De Villiers underpinned South Africa's innings with a sparkling 82-ball 99 as they reached 341 for six, before taking two for 15 from three overs as the UAE were bowled out for 195 in response with 15 balls remaining. De Villiers surprisingly fell one run short of his century, but will take consolation from having smashed four sixes to take his total to 20 at this showpiece - the most at the tournament - and a record 36 in 21 World Cup matches overall. South Africa captain AB de Villiers (right) inspired his country to a comfortable win against the UAE . The explosive batsman hit 99 for the Proteas as they continued they impressive form in the World Cup . De Villers also took two wickets with the ball at the Wellington Regional Stadium on Thursday . The victory was as comfortable as the margin suggests for South Africa as the UAE slumped to a fifth defeat in as many World Cup games. The Proteas, already through to the knockout phase, set the formidable target after being asked to bat first at Westpac Stadium. De Villiers shared a 108-run fourth-wicket stand with David Miller, after Hashim Amla (12), Quinton de Kock (26) and Rilee Rossouw (43) had departed, and added a further 53 in partnership with JP Duminy. Miller was dismissed one run short of his half-century at the start of the 37th over, bowled by Mohammad Naveed, who claimed figures of three for 63. De Villiers had been let off the hook on 63 when he offered a caught-and-bowled chance trying to go down the ground to Amjad Javed, and looked set to notch his hundred only to slice a wide length ball from Kamran Shazad straight to Javed at short third man. His departure signalled the arrival of Farhaan Behardien, though, and his quick-fire 64 not out from just 31 deliveries kept the South African score racing along. Farhaan Bahardien also shone for South Africa with the bat in Wellington . UAE have lost all five of their World Cup games so far this year and were 45-3 after 12.3 overs . Duminy (23) became Naveed's third victim when he was trapped lbw, but Behardien and Vernon Philander (10 not out) took the total past 300 in an unbroken 49-run seventh-wicket stand. The UAE's long-shot chances of chasing down that total were dealt a heavy blow as they slumped to 45 for three after just 12.3 overs. Morne Morkel led the early charge for the Proteas, dismissing Andri Berenger (five) and Khurram Khan (12) as he took two for four from his first four overs, while Duminy claimed Amjad Ali's (21) wicket in between. Shaiman Anwar and Swapnil Patil put on 63 in a fourth-wicket stand that provided a brief respite, but when Anwar (39) sent Imran Tahir's delivery straight to mid-wicket they began to tumble again. Saqlain Haider (seven) replaced Anwar at the crease, but he only lasted three overs to become De Villiers' first victim of the day, before Javed (five) followed suit soon after to leave the UAE on 125 for six with 15.4 overs left. De Villiers rounded off his display with a simple catch as Naveed (17) top-edged Philander tamely to mid-wicket and the subsequent departures of Mohammad Tauqir (three) and Shazad (nought) meant the UAE fell short of completing their 50 overs. Swapnil Patil wsa the only plus point in the batting display as he passed 50 .\n",

'We ask that you do not approach Kerr, as he is considered dangerous. You should contact the police straight away on 999 and officers will be despatched to arrest him or investigate the sighting.' Mr Clarke said he is also appealing directly to Kerr. The officer said: 'William, you know you have breached your licence conditions, and by continuing to do so you are only making things worse. 'It is now time to do the right thing and hand yourself in to the police.' He urged anyone with information to call 999 and pass details to North Yorkshire Police stating the 'William Kerr appeal'. He said people could also contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, quoting North Yorkshire Police reference number 12150049525 and saying it is 'urgent'.\n",
        "output": "William Kerr was jailed for life for the murder of Maureen Comfort in 1998 . He was released on licence in January and moved to probation hostel . The 53-year-old absconded and needs to be arrested and returned to jail .\n"

        "input": "It is the favourite winter holiday of the middle and upper classes - a week in a European ski resort, with days spent exploring the mountain slopes and evening tucking in to local food. But for some, the time spent at some of the highest spots in Europe is focused more on drinking, sex and partying into the small hours. Welcome to the Andorran resort of Pas De La Casa, where it seems holidays are all about boarding, bargain booze and budget holidays. Scroll down for video . Pas De La Casa is all about boarding, bargain booze and budget holidays . Channel 5 documentary Brits on the Piste has looked in to the antics of the workers who spend the winter season in the mountains and the holidaymakers who visit. And the series, currently airing, has proved so popular that viewing figures doubled over the first two episodes. With Pas De La Casa having the reputation as having the one of the best nightlife scenes of any ski resort, it's certainly an eye-opening experience. The four main bars, that are packed out during ski season, are The Milwaukee, Underground, Paddy's Bar and The Shamrocks. From downing shots in the bars, to having an early morning skiing lesson with 'Dreadlock Dave' and partying with DJ Craig, the 'Pete Tong of Pas', all things are covered. And it's not just the visitors behaving badly. The 30 or so British workers at the resort will often drink and part as much as the tourists, with one worker admitting she will have about '20 shots' while working behind the bar. Fellow barman Danny admits that in the previous season he slept with 15 girls, but says he is aiming for 22-25 this season. Despite the cold weather, there's always time to take to the Jacuzzi, and these tourists from Wales take the plunge . Following a night on the tiles, it wouldn't be wise to miss your early morning ski lesson with 'Dreadlock Dave,' pictured here with bar worker Beth . It seems skiing is not particularly high on the agenda for visitors, despite the high costs of booking winter holidays. Two lively party girls from Ireland find themselves on holiday for five days longer than they planned in episode three, while competitive Craig organises an alcohol-fuelled snowman-building competition, and three hungover resort workers go heli-skiing. 'We were meant to book it for five days,' say the two Irish visitors. 'But we hit the wrong button on Ryanair and we're here for ten.' 'Everyone keeps saying to us 'you're total p*******s and you're not going to make the slopes,' but realistically probably all we'll make is one day on the slopes.' Group trips are particularly popular at the bargain resort. Fierce drinking battles between Team Essex and Team Bournemouth - a groups of friends who had swapped sand for snow to party hard - take place in the resort's bars. Both sides of life at the ski resort are show here, from necking beers and shots on a wild night out, to a moment of romance as Joe proposes to his girlfriend Michelle on the slopes . A group of party animals from Yorkshire get into the spirit to celebrate one of their birthdays . Meanwhile three brothers from Kidderminster, who are travelling to the resort for the first time without their parents, are under no illusions what they're there for. Engineer Scott, 19, says: 'This year we're allowed to go mental, completely mental. Just go out there and get smashed, every night, just drink hard and ski harder.' Twenty bottles of J\u00e4germeister and a further 20 of vodka are sold every night in the resort's bars, so it's little wonder party animals flood the venue. The resort is very male-dominant, with 95 per cent of those who stay there being men. And where alcohol and pride is concerned, this can lead to a tense atmosphere at time. Episode four shows how things can take a turn for the worst as skiing takes a back seat for most of the holidaymakers, replaced with drinking, vomiting and fighting. A group of lads from Leeds talk through how the drinking games fit into skiing. This pair from Essex are forced to show their drinking prowess when they come up with some rival holiday-goers from Bournemouth . 'If you fall over it's a shot, if you fall over coming off a ski-lift that's two shots, if you mack (take) somebody out that's a pint,' says Byron. 'If you're sick that's five shots,' adds his friend Johnny. 'It's just a vicious circle basically.' The show also explores those much-discussed resort relationships, from bar workers Danny from Paddy's and Milwaukee's Beth. Despite being on, off and then on again, the pair work out how they are going to surprise each other for Valentine's Day. And in the latest offering, the other side of life at the ski resort is revealed when Joe from Stevenage pops the question to his girlfriend Michelle, complete on bended knee in the snow. Brits on the Piste is shown on 5* and the next episode is Sunday, March 8 at 11pm.\n",
        "output": "Documentary claims resort is about bargain booze and budget holidays . Pas De La Casa Skiing doesn't get in the way of endless shots and beers downed in bars . But you better not let a hangover get in the way of a ski lesson with 'Dreadlock Dave'\n"

        "input": "(CNN)On October 24, 1944, U.S. warplanes swarmed at the Leviathan of battleships, Japan's Musashi, splashing down torpedoes or dive bombing it. It took them four hours and more than 25 direct hits to put one of the two largest war ships in World War II to the bottom of the Philippines' Sibuyan Sea. This month, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and a team of researchers found a sprawling undersea wreck after an eight-year search for the Musashi. Japanese maritime expert Kazushige Todaka is 90% sure they found the right ship after the first images were published earlier in March. And that's a breakthrough. \"I have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered, but they all turned out not to be true,\" Todaka said. Unfortunately, Japanese war ships did not bear their names on their sides, so a full identification takes a while. But the wreckage matched the ship's description, and it had a mount for the Imperial Japanese Navy seal, a chrysanthemum which was made out of teak and rotted away in the ship's 70 years in the sea. On Thursday, Paul Allen's team treated the world to a live tour from the wreck at nearly 4,000 feet under the waves. An unmanned vehicle's spotlights lit up the pitch darkness, revealing crisp high definition images of massive rusted iron in crystal clear turquoise water. The live tour began with one of the Musashi's many death blows -- a warped bow. \"What we see here is torpedo damage,\" said Robert Kraft, the expedition's leader. Torpedoes usually punctured the hull and exploded inside the ship, belling the metal outward. The remote operated vehicle puttered past more fatal damage, as Kraft and his team described it. A big dent pushing inward, he explained, was likely from a torpedo that barely missed the ship, exploding outside the hull, pushing it in. \"It's the concussive force next to the ship,\" he said. The submersible showed multiple hits right under the Musashi's main gun, perhaps the most powerful naval cannon at that time. It weighed 270 tons, and gunners had to duck into a blast shelter before firing it to keep from getting killed. While in the Musashi's death throes, the gun discharged one time before everyone took cover and blew sailors off the ship's deck, Allen's researchers said. It was one of three such guns followed by rows of other guns. The Musashi was the most heavily armed ship of its time, the researchers said. But the giant had an Achilles heel. It was very vulnerable to torpedoes. The ship caught fire; it lost most of its propeller power and began to flail. U.S. warplanes went in for the kill. \"No defenses would have saved her,\" an expedition member commented, as the submersible drifted past one gun turret or gun mount after the next. As the Musashi sank, parts of it, where air was trapped imploded. The wreck landed in pieces on the sea floor with some 1,000 crew members. About 1,300 more were rescued by other Japanese ships, including the executive officer. The camera appeared to spare viewers any skeletal remains, but among unfired shells and bent iron, small objects peered at the lens. Could the small chain have been a necklace? Pocket watch chain? Those wanting to answer those questions themselves will find the recording of the tour archived on Allen's website. Launched in 1940, the Musashi was, at the time, in the largest class of warship ever constructed, displacing more than 69,000 tons. It had a twin, the Yamato. The U.S. Navy sank the Musashi during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the central Philippines. Microsoft billionaire Allen has said his long fascination with World War II history was inspired by his father's service in the U.S. Army. To finally arrive at the wreck, Kraft's team scoured historical records from four countries and undersea topographical data before sending down detection devices, such as the Bluefins that have searched for missing airliner Malaysia Airlines flight 370. Nearly a decade passed before they had the wreck in their sites. \"That moment of discovery was exhilarating,\" Kraft said. CNN's Euan McKirdy, Jethro Mullen, Yoko Wakatsuki and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.\n",

The event at the Holy Martyrs Brancoveni school, an Orthodox Christian school in the city of Constanta, south-east Romania is part of an annual festival. Organisers say the play was meant to be a portrayal of the execution of Constantin Brancoveanu, a king of Wallachia, and his five sons, in 1714. But a short film showing five children, all under 10, leaning over a block while an older child pretends to chop off their heads was recently posted online - \u00a0and quickly faced a raft of criticism in the wake of the public executions by ISIS. A Romanian school has come under fire for putting on a play in which young children were told to say their prayers and then pretend to have their heads chopped off by a masked executioner . A short film showing five children all aged under 10 lent over a block while an older child pretends to chop off their heads was recently posted online . Organisers say the play was meant to be a portrayal of the execution of Constantin Brancoveanu, a king of Wallachia, and his five sons, in 1714 . In the video the hooded executioner carries a plastic axe and decapitates the children one at a time. Then at the very end the child playing the King in the play is executed after seeing all of his children killed. The short clip concludes with parents and children in the audience applauding the child actors. It quickly attracted criticism from education officials although the school, parents and a priest who was involved in creating the play defended the decision. The Association of the Pupils of Constanta publicly criticised the move saying that the drama was inappropriate for the children. In a statement it said: 'A very worrying fact about this whole affair is that people who played Constantin Branconveanu and his sons were young children, students younger than 10. They were exposed and subjected to simulated scenes of violence, which can seriously affect their psycho-social development and can induce violent attitudes.

What was filmed and released on social media sites was taken out of the coninput of a bigger festival, which was very educational. 'The parents thought the same way and they fully supports us. As well as the kids, who understood the meaning of what we were doing and were not emotionally affected. 'What really affected them was the press reaction, because they worked very hard to play their parts, and they are upset about the way their efforts were presented.'\n",

        "input": "George North should be stopped from playing rugby until the World Cup in September after suffering his third bout of concussion in four months. That is the view of former Scotland full back Rory Lamont, who fears for the Wales and Northampton winger\u2019s long-term health after revealing his own battle against depression as a result of multiple head injuries. North was left unconscious in Friday night\u2019s Aviva Premiership fixture against Wasps and Lamont, knocked out 12 times during his career, is convinced the 22-year-old has been \u2018let down.' Rory Lamont reveals he battled depression after suffering 12 concussion during his rugby career . The weight of impact required to cause a bout of concussion reduces the more times a player suffers head injuries. Yet there are indications that North could still play against Clermont Auvergne in the Champions Cup quarter-final on Saturday. \u2018It\u2019s a complete disgrace that it\u2019s got to this stage,\u2019 Lamont told Sportsmail. \u2018George has been let down. That a player can still be exposed to this at the top level is crazy. They\u2019ve tipped him over the edge now because he\u2019s had too many concussions in a short period of time. He should take six months out, but even then he will be increasingly susceptible. \u2018I\u2019ve got metal plates in my jaw, cheekbone and eye socket, but it\u2019s the unseen damage that worries me. There are still moments during the day when I can\u2019t remember my best friend\u2019s name. I went through depression, irritability and lack of form after these knocks. George North was knocked out again and was forced off after a clash with Nathan Hughes of Wasps . \u2018I nearly walked away from the game in 2008 and, if I\u2019d had the same information that\u2019s mainstream today, I probably would have. If the brain is gone, you\u2019re just left with an empty vessel.\u2019 North, who was concussed when playing against the All Blacks in November, remarked that \u2018rugby is not tiddlywinks\u2019 after he was knocked out twice against England last month. \u2018There\u2019s this standard bravado attitude,\u2019 said 32-year-old Lamont, who believes there is a cultural problem that needs to be addressed. \u2018George is right: it\u2019s not tiddlywinks. But this is brain damage we\u2019re talking about and it can lead to early onset dementia. Lamont has been knocked out 12 times and has suffered because of the multiple head injuries . 'Players don\u2019t want to dig in and face up to the dangers. They have committed themselves to this career and they love it \u2014 it\u2019s so much fun. There\u2019s a wilful ignorance because you don\u2019t want to accept the thing you love might end up killing you. \u2018I know an England international who suffered a few concussions in one season and now, as a result, he suffers panic attacks. But he\u2019s still playing because the thought of stopping is too scary. The money is coming in and he\u2019s hanging out with his mates every day. \u2018The players just aren\u2019t educated: a lot of my friends are still playing and their knowledge of the long-term implications is shocking.\u2019 North was unable to continue and Lamont thinks that he should be prevented from playing until the World Cup . North\u2019s latest concussion occurred when he was caught by the knee of Wasps No 8 Nathan Hughes, who was shown a red card and will face an RFU disciplinary panel this evening. After the game Northampton issued a statement, saying: \u2018North will continue to be monitored by the Saints\u2019 experienced medical team throughout the weekend. \u2018As with everyone in the squad, Northampton Saints place the highest importance on player welfare and as such North will see a specialist early next week for an assessment.\u2019 Wales medical manager Prav Mathema has also been in dialogue with Northampton\u2019s doctors over the weekend. There was immediate concern for North after the incident and Hughes was shown a red card for the clash . Any subsequent decisions will be highly scrutinised, with North\u2019s double blow against England becoming one of the most controversial incidents of the RBS Six Nations. The WRU were cleared of any wrongdoing after North was allowed to stay on the field but Lamont, whose countryman Tim Visser signed for Harlequins yesterday, feels the World Rugby body need to take a more pro-active stance. Return-to-play protocols permit players to be available for selection within six days if they are symptom free, while boxers face a mandatory, 90-day stand-down if they lose consciousness for less than a minute. \u2018We need to preserve George\u2019s career and life after his career,\u2019 said Lamont. George North suffered concussion against England in the Six Nations but played on for the rest of the match . \u2018But I just don\u2019t know if rugby is going to manage him properly. Even if he passes all the assessments, they are far too flawed. There will be great pressure to get him fit for the business end of the season but you\u2019re playing with fire. He needs to be protected from his club and country. Independent experts need to make the decision. \u2018Far too much faith is put in the protocols. When a player gets concussed it should be an absolute minimum of 21 days\u2019 rest. There\u2019s no way they should be playing six days later. A bruised leg doesn\u2019t recover in six days and a bruised brain certainly doesn\u2019t. \u2018Because we can\u2019t see a bruised brain, people don\u2019t look at it the same way. It\u2019s utter nonsense and business aspects are prioritised above player welfare. There is no room for error.\u2019\n",

Passenger Akash Jain said he jumped off the plane to perform a stunt like actor Akshay Kumar . Friday\u2019s incident sparked a security scare at Mumbai\u2019s Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and raised serious questions about how Mr Jain was able to elude police and airport security officers. Mr Jain opened the emergency exit moments after the Boeing 737, carrying 144 passengers and five crew, pulled up to a gate after arriving from Chandigarh. After leaping off the plane in front of stunned passengers on flight 9W469, he entered the arrivals terminal after asking a ground crew member for directions and left the airport without being apprehended. The passenger who leaped from the plane said he was imitating his idol, Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar (left) Having missed his connecting flight, Mr Jain travelled by bus and taxi towards his destination in Goa, but returned to Mumbai after he spoke to his mother by telephone and learned that his father was not feeling well, Mid Day reported. Mr Jain, who works as a medical representative, planned to travel home to Jalandhar, but was arrested by police in Mumbai on Saturday night after a CCTV image from the airport was circulated by local media and someone reported his whereabouts, the news website reported. The amateur stuntman is being held in custody for a week, but he may spend more time in custody if he is not granted bail. Akash Jain entered the arrivals terminal after he asked a ground crew member for directions to an exit . An airport police officer told Mid Day: \u2018He told us that he had seen Akshay Kumar performing stunts in the movies and wanted to perform one himself. \u2018He added that the fact that passengers are repeatedly told to open the emergency doors only in case of an emergency made him want to open it more.\u2019 The incident sparked a furious response from airport bosses, who accused Jet Airways of failing to immediately alert the proper authorities. An airport spokesperson said: \u2018If the incident took place after the aircraft landed, why didn\u2019t the airline security staff inform the security agencies immediately? \u2018Why did they need 35 minutes to do so?\u2019 A Jet Airways spokesperson denied the claim, telling MailOnline Travel that security agencies were notified immediately. The airline spokesperson added: \u2018A guest travelling on Jet Airways flight 9W469 from Chandigarh to Mumbai opened the emergency door and disembarked, alighting onto the aircraft\u2019s wings after the aircraft had come to a standstill at the parking bay at Mumbai airport.\u2019\n",

The $4.8 million gold heist by three armed robbers unfolded after one of the two armed guards said that he felt sick and prompted the driver to pull over. But Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. said Wednesday that different stories have emerged about the trip\u00a0from Bridgewater, Massachusetts on I-95. Scroll down for video . Investigation: Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr, pictured, said that differing stories from the guards about the armed robbery had led to suspicions over their accounts of heist . Suspects:\u00a0Woodard shared sketches of the suspects thought to be male and possibly Hispanic who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger - there are three suspects altogether . White van: Two security guards working for Transvalue Inc of Miami were reportedly approached by three armed men driving a white van, pictured here, after pulling over on the interstate . In the latest account of events, one of the two armed guards said that he felt sick and this is why the driver pulled over. However, in an earlier description the guards, \u00a0employed by Miami-based company, TransValue Inc. said a mechanical issue had caused the driver to stop. The guards said that after the vehicle stopped they were approached by three armed men driving a white van who ordered them to lie on the ground. They then tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods before taking 275lbs of gold. Woodward told reporters that these differing accounts have led to further investigations. 'There is suspicion at this time that this could be an inside job due to the circumstances of the robbery,'\u00a0a Wilson County Sheriff's Office detective wrote in a search warrant obtained by ABC. 'The fact that the truck was robbed immediately upon it pulling over at an unannounced stop is suspicious in and of itself,' the document added.

It is not believed that this is a random act due to the nature and facts of this robbery.' Police are now seeking a search warrant for the phones of the armed guard who felt sick because of the suspicious nature of the case. Woodard shared sketches of the three suspects who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger. Meanwhile, a photo was shown of a traffic cone that was positioned behind the truck as suspects allegedly removed gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back. The traffic cone had the marking of a company that only does work in Florida, according to ABC. Woodard said the driver and the passenger, who speak little English, are not suspects, but both men have been interviewed separately several times by police. He added that the driver and the passenger did violate their company\u2019s policies by exiting the vehicle without their firearms and leaving the firearms inside the truck.

A British tourist struck down by 'the bends' on a scuba diving trip in the Maldives died after it took nine hours to get her to a decompression chamber. An inquest heard Melanie Stoddart, 38, died of decompression sickness shortly after arriving in the Indian Ocean island for a 12-day holiday with her boyfriend. There was a delay in Ms Stoddart receiving medical help because there was initially no boat or plane to take her to hospital. And upon her arrival at hospital, medics did not even treat her for decompression sickness, the inquest into her death was told. Her parents, Peter, 68, and Irene, 64, slammed the 'sheer incompetence' of the authorities in the Maldives and warned other tourists to 'take note' before booking a similar trip. The inquest in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, heard how Ms Stoddart, an experienced diver from Prestwich in Greater Manchester, had arrived in the Maldives on April, 1, 2012 with her boyfriend Steve Greathead. She had been on the same holiday the previous year. On the third day of her organised trip, she was in a party of 12 holidaymakers and two instructors who went to Vaavu Atoll for the last scuba dive of the day just after 3pm. The inquest was told she returned to the surface after about 30 minutes and asked for medical help as she was feeling unwell. Doctors were called and she was taken to the exclusive Alimatha Aquatic Resort nearby. When it became clear her condition was deteriorating the resort's doctor said she needed to be taken to a decompression chamber, but there was no transport available. A speed boat only arrived from neighbouring Bandos Island, more than 40 miles away, when insurance checks had been carried out. A doctor sedated Ms Stoddart, but decided she was not stable enough to be put in a decompression chamber. She was then transferred for a second time by boat six miles to the capital of Male where CT scans of her head and chest were taken at the ADK Hospital. But at 2.15am the next morning she went into cardiac arrest and died half an hour later. Doctors were called and she was taken to the exclusive Alimatha Aquatic Resort (pictured) nearby . The court heard how Ms Stoddart, an experienced diver, had arrived in the Maldives on April, 1, 2012 with her boyfriend Steve Greathead. She had been on the same holiday the previous year . Initially a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and it took specialist tests carried out on samples of brain tissue to detect\u00a0damage caused by nitrogen bubbles being present in her blood stream. Divers' disease, or 'the bends', is a condition caused from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. Consultant Pathologist Dr Andrew Hitchcock told the hearing that the minute damage caused by the bubbles and a ruptured left ear drum suggested Ms Stoddart had decompression syndrome. Her father, Peter Stoddart, of Holmeswood, Derbyshire, told the court his daughter was a qualified diving instructor and member of a club who had dived all over the world. 'Nothing was too much for her, she never failed and was never fazed,' he said. He said the family had spotted 'discrepancies' in the reports from police and tour company Scuba Tours Worldwide which raised serious questions about the safety procedures in place. 'It's my opinion there were no proper safety procedures in place on these islands,' he said. 'For a people and a country that relies on diving for its main income I would assume there would have been. 'The time lapse was nine hours and that is just not acceptable,' he added. 'If she had been in a chamber within an hour she would have been stable enough to deal with it.' Melanie Stoddart was diving from the MV Sea Spirit (pictured) in the Maldives when she was taken ill . The ADK Hospital in the Maldives capital of Male where Ms Stoddart died in the early hours on April 4, 2012 . Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Paul McCandless said: 'Melanie was a practiced and experienced sea diver who took unwell on a dive. Due to a lack of appropriate transport at that time of day there was a delay in taking her to an appropriate facility. 'Once there, there was a partial misdiagnosis that she was not suffering from compression sickness. She was deemed to be too unwell to go into the chamber and was transferred to hospital . 'It is possible that if her condition had been diagnosed sooner that she would not have died when she did.' He added: 'Holidaymakers need to be aware of what emergency procedures are in place should any particular difficulties arise.' After the hearing Melanie's mother Irene, 64, said: 'My daughter's death was down to sheer incompetence. She received no treatment for nine hours, how can that be right?' MailOnline has contacted tour company Scuba Tours Worldwide for a comment.\n",

Throughout practice at the Sepang International Circuit Raikkonen had suggested a top-three position was on the cards as he emerged the closest rival to Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. But come qualifying, and the start of the second session with a storm brewing overhead, the Finn found himself out of position in the queue to take to the track and set a banker lap.

With team-mate Sebastian Vettel at the head of the line of cars, the four-times champion eventually emerged quickest in Q2 as the drivers only had time for one hot lap before the heavens opened. That lap proved to be a mad scramble from which Raikkonen could only qualify 11th, with Sauber's Marcus Ericsson his undoing. 'I tried to overtake Ericsson because he was in front of me,' said Raikkonen. 'But at the last corner I couldn't slow down because there were other people pushing me forward. 'In my mind we just got the timing wrong. That's how it ended up.' Television pictures of qualifying showed lightning and stormy conditions approaching the circuit . Dark clouds gather in the background at the Sepang International Circuit during the qualifying session . Raikkonen, though, opted not to point an accusing finger at his team, adding: 'I don't know if it helps to blame anyone.

'Obviously, we have made our life very difficult, so I have no idea what we will do tomorrow. We will try our best and see where we end up.'

The car felt good in both dry and wet conditions at the end. 'I'm reasonably happy, and also the long runs look good on practice days, so we should be in good shape, but we know they (Mercedes) are difficult to beat.

The rules, which come into force next month after FIFA passed the buck on managing the middle men to national associations, include a ban on agents earning money for representing players under 18 years old. As a result, clubs fear there will no longer be a level playing field in the global hunt for young talent because the players\u2019 representatives will want them to sign for teams in countries where the agents\u2019 code is far more relaxed. Arsene Wenger vents his frustration on the sideline as Arsenal crash out of the Champions League . Lionel Messi (second left) was at his mesmerising best as Barcelona beat Manchester City on Wednesday . And English clubs, who will abide by the rules, have further worries on how these restrictions will be policed by the FA, with agents no longer needing a licence to operate. The competitive market in signing teenage prospects is shown by the Chelsea juniors who have just reached their fourth consecutive FA Youth Cup final. Among the class of 2015 are Jay Dasilva, plucked from Luton at 13, while Isaiah Brown, on the fringe of the first team, arrived from West Bromwich at 16.

It was the most conclusive testimony to date in the monthlong trial that puts a weapon in Hernandez's hand around the time of the slaying. Hernandez is charged with murder in the killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Lloyd was shot to death early on June 17, 2013, in an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, sending his last input message at 3:23am, and two witnesses have testified they heard loud bangs around that time. The murder weapon has never been found. Scroll down for video . Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez sits in court during his trial . Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez is seen in footage from his home security system . A handgun is shown during the murder trial for former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez . Kyle Aspinwall, a former New Hampshire police chief who now works for Glock, began his testimony Wednesday by showing jurors a Glock 21. The semiautomatic handgun uses .45-caliber bullets, and prosecutors have argued that based on ballistics evidence, a Glock 21 was the murder weapon. As Aspinwall testified, prosecutor Patrick Bomberg played clips of video recorded by Hernandez's extensive home surveillance system June 17, as well as still photos taken from the videos. At several points in the video, Hernandez can be seen carrying a black object in his hand, an object his defense team has said could have been a TV remote or another electronic device. But Aspinwall said his opinion was based on various characteristics of the weapon, including the curvature of back strap, the magazine well and trigger guard. 'In my opinion, the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol,' he said. The earliest clip played Wednesday was taken at around 12:45am before Hernandez leaves the house with co-defendants Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace in a rental car. Prosecutors have said the three picked up Lloyd in Boston, then drove him back to North Attleborough. Ortiz and Wallace are also charged with murder and have pleaded not guilty. They will be tried at a later date.

'This is a picture of the defendant holding what appears to be a handgun in his left hand in a reverse grip,' Aspinwall said. At various points in his testimony, Aspinwall stood and used his Glock to demonstrate how Hernandez was holding the weapon. At around 2:30pm, less than 12 hours after the killing, other video shows Hernandez and Wallace hanging out by the pool before Hernandez gets a black object out of the rental car.

The closest he has come to risking his unbeaten record abroad has been in two relatively insignificant fights in the Caribbean in 2007 and 2008. Froch suspects Ward believes he will relinquish the WBA belt, as he did his IBF world championship last month. But he warns: \u2018I vacated the IBF title so as not to delay James DeGale from getting his chance any longer. But I\u2019m not giving up the WBA title. No way.\u2019 Froch is aware that without him bringing a belt to the table there would be little incentive for Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr to go ahead with a fight in Las Vegas, which is one of the Cobra\u2019s two remaining ambitions. Froch lost to Ward on points back in December 2011 in Atlantic City, New Jersey . That defeat for the Cobra was one of only two in his career as a professional . The other is to box at the ground of his beloved Forest, which was the potential venue for a clash with America\u2019s veteran idol Bernard Hopkins. Froch accepts that the WBA mandatory ruling means Ward must now take the place of Hopkins in those talks. The WBA are giving them until the end of this month to negotiate terms, before putting the fight out to purse bids. Froch expects that to happen, which might necessitate a change of dates. Promoter Eddie Hearn, with whom he meets this week to discuss strategy for the negotiations, is provisionally holding the City Ground for May 30. That is the night of the FA Cup final and there would be a sizeable over-carry of TV viewers from Wembley on to pay-per-view with Sky. But Froch says: \u2018That is already short notice for me and if we have to wait for purse bids there won\u2019t be time for proper training camps for either of us. I would hope we can find another date in middle to late June.\u2019 He has been pondering retirement since his brutal KO of George Groves at Wembley. That remains an option, even though he has kept working in the gym to maintain an impressive physique, as a recent picture posted on Twitter reveals. Froch had been due to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (left) but was forced out with an injury . Froch is also keen to fight ring legend Bernard Hopkins (left) who lost to Sergey Kovalev last year . \u2018I will only get back in the ring for a fight that really floats my boat,\u2019 says Froch. \u2018And when you think about it, beating Ward in Nottingham would be a fantastic way to end my career.\u2019 Highly regarded though Ward is, such a triumph is not beyond the realm of possibility. In fact, the timing would offer Froch his best chance of avenging one of the only two losses on his record \u2013 as well as inflicting a first defeat on Ward. Embroiled in promotional disputes and plagued by injuries, Ward has fought only once in two-and-a-half years. And that was a full year and four months ago in a points victory over Edwin Rodriguez, who had failed to make the weight and mostly went through the motions of a non-title bout. Froch says: \u2018The nine months since I knocked out George is the longest I\u2019ve been out but Ward has to be really rusty. \u2018Also, a lot went wrong for me in that Super Six final. I was looking forward to appearing in Madison Square Garden but it was moved to Atlantic City .Out on the shore in the cold of mid-winter. Disappointing. The date was pushed back so I had to hang around in America a lot longer than planned. It ended up a week before Christmas and my mind was on getting home to the family instead of the fight. \u2018It\u2019ll be very different in the English summer.\u2019 And what more pleasant time could there be to re-float the boat?\n",

But more than four months after the headline-grabbing announcement that she was to join the NBC network as a special correspondent in a \u00a3400,000 deal, she has yet to be seen on screen \u2013 and friends say she has decided against taking up a full-time job in the United States. The Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s sister has shot a series of reports for the long-running Today show in rural Wyoming, but none has seen the light of day. And it was only when The Mail on Sunday asked why the footage had not been aired that a source close to Pippa explained that she was not ready to commit to the demands of a job in the US. The source said: \u2018There were talks and Pippa did a test shoot which went really well. But for various reasons, a regular show with Pippa isn\u2019t going to happen. Ultimately she didn\u2019t want to commit herself to a big job in the US. She\u2019s got a boyfriend in Geneva and her family in the UK. It was too much for her to pack up and leave them behind. \u2018She will be working with the network on an ad hoc basis. \u2018NBC were really pleased with the test shoot, but she is not going to be signing a major deal to be a special correspondent, which is what NBC wanted. It was Pippa\u2019s decision not to go ahead. It\u2019s not where she sees her future.\u2019 One NBC insider said: \u2018Pippa \u2013 or the lack of her \u2013 has been the talk of the company. Everyone is wondering what has happened to her? \u2018There was all that fanfare when she went off to Wyoming, and the word then was that she would start doing segments as a roving reporter here and occasionally appear in the studio. But there\u2019s been nothing but silence for months. It\u2019s clear that someone has had reservations \u2013 but whether that\u2019s from NBC\u2019s side or her side, who knows? \u2018It seems odd that they should make such a fuss of her and be so public and then go so silent. \u2018Normally, after a big build-up like that, you\u2019d get the talent on air fast and give her a big push. It doesn\u2019t feel right at all.\u2019 In Wyoming, Pippa donned tight jeans, a flannel shirt and cowboy boots to twirl on the dance floor of a Western bar, rode a horse in the shadow of the Teton mountains, and visited tourist sights in a cowboy town. Interviewees were told the story would air within about ten days of the shoot last November \u2013 but have been left disappointed. \u2018We\u2019re wondering what happened to the report,\u2019 says Jim Waldrop, manager of the Wort Hotel in Jackson Hole, where Pippa filmed. \u2018I contacted the producer, but they don\u2019t have any information about when it might air.\u2019 Scroll down for video . In Wyoming, Pippa donned tight jeans, a flannel shirt and cowboy boots to twirl on the dance floor of a Western bar (above) Angus Thuerman, former editor of the Jackson Hole News & Guide, added: \u2018I was told it was like a pilot episode, an experiment to see how she did. She seemed quite at home, relaxed and enjoying herself.\u2019 Novelist Nanci Turner Steveson, who attended Pippa\u2019s filming session, says: \u2018Pippa seemed tiny and sweet, but maybe a bit overwhelmed There were so many people there \u2013 two or three cameramen, producers, sound technicians and bodyguards, all on a fairly small dance floor, dancing to the band One Ton Pig. A cowboy taught her to dance a two-step and she picked it up pretty quickly. But NBC seemed to be making a lot of fuss over a very small story.\u2019 Chris Koch, 66, a regular at the Silver Dollar bar, said: \u2018I was asked by NBC if I\u2019d be filmed dancing with Pippa Middleton. I had no idea who she is. My daughter told me, \u201cShe\u2019s Kate Middleton\u2019s sister!\u201d and I said: \u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d I don\u2019t know what happened to the Today story, and I don\u2019t much care \u2013 I don\u2019t have a TV.\u2019 Pippa\u2019s NBC deal was initially touted as \u2018provisional\u2019, although the network has a history of signing those related to the great and the good. Other NBC correspondents have included Sarah Ferguson, Bill Clinton\u2019s daughter Chelsea, and Princess Diana\u2019s brother Charles Spencer.

A man who shot his dying wife 14 times as she was hanging from a noose can continue to live freely in Britain \u2013 after judges refused to extradite him. Branko Loncar, 55, has won a long legal battle against being returned to Croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder, despite committing further crimes, including an assault, while living in London. He earlier won asylum after complaining he had to flee Croatia because of anti-Serb discrimination \u2013 and his lawyers argued locals would persecute him over the shooting. Last week\u2019s High Court ruling is a sharp reminder that while the Government talks of ejecting foreign criminals, in practice the criminals routinely win the right to stay here. Loncar, who has been on benefits and had a drink problem since arriving in Britain with his two sons in 1999, made the extraordinary defence that he was not aiming at his wife when he fired repeatedly from a few yards away. In any case, his lawyers claimed, she died as a result of hanging herself, not because of the 14 bullets he \u2018accidentally\u2019 fired into her defenceless body. A Croatian court which heard the case in his absence rejected his defence, sentenced him to four years in prison, and ten years ago the country formally issued an international arrest warrant and requested his extradition from Britain. His lawyers first successfully fought against the extradition on human rights grounds, arguing that he had a new Serbian \u2018partner\u2019 in Britain \u2013 who actually lives a hundred miles away \u2013 and that he now had grandchildren in London. And last week British judges finished off the extradition bid for ever, giving Loncar the right to remain free here, after ruling it \u2018oppressive\u2019 to send him back to prison in Croatia after so long. He was also commended for raising his children alone after shooting his wife. Speaking in broken English to the Daily Mail last night at his housing association flat close to fashionable Camden in North London, Loncar said he had every right to remain in Britain, adding: \u2018Croatia is dangerous \u2013 they still want me there.\u2019 The case began in 1994, amid the chaos of the Balkan wars, when Loncar, an ethnic Serb and former soldier in the Yugoslavian army, lived with his wife Mirjana and two sons in the village of Ostrovo. The area was declared part of a Serbian republic but was also claimed by Croatia. UK court documents note: \u2018After a quarrel with his wife Mirjana, she went out of the house, stood on a ladder, took a rope and indicated she intended to kill herself. As she stood from the ladder and the noose tightened around her neck and rendered her unconscious, the defendant fired a number of bullets into her body. \u2018The cause of death was determined to be by strangulation but was accelerated by the injuries inflicted from the defendant\u2019s gun. The defendant was charged with murder.\u2019 The subsequent trial \u2013 by a Serbian court \u2013 heard that Loncar had fired 14 shots from his handgun \u2018causing a number of injuries\u2019. Last week, British judges finished off the extradition bid for ever, giving Loncar the right to remain free in the UK, by ruling in the High Court (pictured) that it would be \u2018oppressive\u2019 to send him back to prison in Croatia . He told the court \u2018that when he saw that his wife had jumped off the ladder, he took the gun and ammunition out of the holster he had under his arm and fired the gun from three to four metres away, but did not know in which direction.\u2019 After a single pathologist claimed Mrs Loncar had already died of strangulation before being shot, he was initially cleared of murder. In 1999 he then flew to England with his children and successfully claimed asylum, saying that his ethnic Serbian children were discriminated against by Croatians at school \u2013 but also complaining of \u2018local antipathy resulting from the death of his wife\u2019. While he began a life on benefits here, Croatia\u2019s supreme court in 2000 ordered a retrial, with Loncar\u2019s village now a part of Croatia, and the following year he was convicted in his absence of attempted murder. Four doctors said Mrs Loncar was still alive when her husband shot her. He was given a four-year prison sentence on the grounds that he \u2018had an intention to kill\u2019. Croatia, a member of the European Union, some years later sought Loncar\u2019s extradition, and in 2006 British police arrested him. A UK court swiftly rejected the request, noting with sympathy that he had to bring up his children alone after shooting his wife. But in 2014 he was arrested again, and although he was immediately freed on bail the case was sent to the High Court in London. Last week\u2019s High Court judgment in Loncar\u2019s favour, by judges Lord Justice Aiken and Mrs Justice Popplewell, the conclusion of the long legal battle, noted: \u2018The offence for which the extradition of Mr Loncar is sought is undoubtedly a very serious one. Moreover, Mr Loncar has not led a blameless life as a British citizen. \u2018He has a caution for theft in 2012 and a conviction for common assault in 2013. Nevertheless we have reached the firm conclusion that it would be oppressive to extradite Mr Loncar by reason of the passage of time.\u2019 The ruling was also sharply critical of the Croatian legal system, and observed that he had served a year in prison before being initially cleared almost 20 years ago. And in reference to the Human Rights Act\u2019s \u2018right to a family life\u2019 clause, judges said Loncar had \u2018been in a relationship with the same partner since prior to 2006, although they do not live together\u2019. Far from living together, the Daily Mail has discovered that \u2018partner\u2019 helping provide him with a \u2018family life\u2019 to maintain here is an ethnic Serb born in Britain and living 100 miles from him in Leicester.\n",

An anxious British mother has not heard from her 18-year-old daughter for five days after Cyclone Pam struck the Oceania island of Vanuatu. Pauline Alpin, 54, said she last received a input message from her daughter Emma Venier - a former head girl at Norwich High School - as she prepared to face Cyclone Pam before it ripped across the tiny island. The storm has killed at least 24 people and left more than 3,300 homeless in the South Pacific island. Ms Alpin, from Norwich, said: 'I have to assume that Emma is OK because I don't want to think anything else. 'She let me know that they were boarding up windows and were on red alert. 'As the days go on I'm just getting worse and worse. I should be at work but I can't go because I just can't concentrate.' Miss Vernier flew out to Vanuatu, about 1,250 miles from Brisbane, Australia, last month to take part in a volunteering project in Ambae, one of the little nation's outer islets. She was due to remain in Vanuatu until July. The area was ravaged over the weekend by the cyclone as raging 185mph winds destroyed homes, boats, roads and bridges and wrecked power and phone lines. The remote outer islands are not thought to have been as badly hit as the central areas and Vanuatu's capital Port Vila but radio and phone lines were still down last night. Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 people spread over more than 80 islands. About 47,000 people live in the capital.

A family who lost their home in the cyclone carry their belongings on the outskirts of Port Vila . The tiny village of Yaohnanen on the southern Vanuatu island of Tanna - where Prince Philip is a divine being - has been 'totally devastated' by the cyclone. Villagers have revered the Duke of Edinburgh after catching a glimpse of him standing on a ship during a royal visit to Vanuatu - known then as the New Hebrides - in the 1970s. In his fine white naval uniform Prince Philip looked like a Deity and so he was 'adopted' as the tribe's personal god. The village, of about 200 people, consisted of little more than wooden huts with thatched roofs - and it was in one of these flimsy dwellings that historic signed photographs, personally sent to the tribe in the 1970s, were being held. Rina George, who has relatives living on the hillside where the village is located, said: 'From what we have heard, everything has been smashed down. Very little has been left.' Ms Alpin, a sonographer, said that she was keeping in contact with the parents of other volunteers that her daughter travelled with. 'We are all as worried as each other. They are so young - one of the other girls is 17 and Emma is only 18', she said. 'They might not even have any idea how bad things are as the lines are all down. 'It has been so sad - people have lost their homes and places are devastated, they need so much help.' Vanuatu's president Baldwin Lonsdale said the storm had 'wiped out' all recent development and his country - one of the world's poorest - and it would have to rebuild 'everything'. He estimated the 'monster' had destroyed or damaged 90 per cent of the buildings in the capital of Port Vila. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are in close contact with the local authorities in Vanuatu. 'We have not yet been asked but we stand ready to provide consular assistance to any British people who need our help. 'Any British person who has been affected by the cyclone can get in touch with us on 020 7008 1500.'

        "input": "(CNN)Utah's governor signed a bill Monday that brings back firing squads as a potential way to execute some death row prisoners. Lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in the state, Gov. Gary R. Herbert said in a statement. A firing squad would only be used in the event the necessary drugs cannot be obtained. \"Those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state,\" said Marty Carpenter, a spokesman for Herbert. \"We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued. However, when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant, enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch,\" he said. Utah banned death by firing squad in 2004, though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death. The last execution by firing squad was in 2010, and it was also the most recent execution in Utah. A Utah firing squad also executed Gary Gilmore in 1977, the first death by capital punishment after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty the prior year.

        "input": "(CNN)When I was a child, a pale specter used to call our house most evenings, eager to chat with my doctor father about her myriad medical concerns. We called her the \"White Bread Lady,\" a moniker she earned for one particularly inane call in which she panicked to my father after consuming white bread. She wasn't breaking out in hives or having any adverse effects to the bread. No, she was just concerned that some future illness could befall her given that one particular dietary decision. Although we all laughed at the time, it was with a bit of shifty-eyed shame. Because most of us (including if not particularly the illustrious Ehrlich family) have lurking within us our very own \"White Bread Lady,\" ready to convince us that each cough, sniffle and less-than-nutritious meal might be a detriment to our health. And, naturally, that White Bread Lady looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information. Yup, so quoth Google, we all have cancer. According to the Pew Research Center, 80% of Internet users have looked up health information online. While that practice can be beneficial in some respects, the abundance of (variably valid) information online can turn us into e-hypochondriacs. (Or, worse, can lead us to neglect getting the care we need.) Read on for five mistakes -- courtesy of a selection of health care professionals -- that people make when diagnosing themselves online. Searching blind . Your eye is twitching like an overly caffeinated college student sitting behind a pretty girl in lecture hall, twirling his pencil and hoping to catch a whiff of her lovely shining hair. You type \"eye twitch\" into Google and come up with a really rad website that explains that this newfound spasm is actually an indication that your third eye is fixing to open, revealing to you wonders untold. You are the chosen one. Too bad that this trove of \"medical information\" is actually some dude's fan-fiction site. Sure, the above is an extreme example, but, as Dr. Kevin Pho of KevinMD.com pointed out, \"There's a lot of bad information on the Web and information that can be dangerous.\" Especially if you're not considering who put up that information in the first place. Pho urges users to favor Web addresses ending in .org and .edu when looking for reputable health-care info, and to check who is funding the collection of that information. \"There's so much information from organizations trying to sell products or push their agenda on the Web,\" he said. He suggests turning to sites like Mayo Clinic as well as troves of information curated by doctors (like Pho's own website) when trolling the web for info. And, of course, if a site mentions trolls and third eyes, one should definitely press on. Flailing in forums . If there's one thing people like to do online, it's talk about their problems -- especially mundane things like coughs and headaches and their babies' various and sundry discharges. That's all well and good; sharing experiences with others is enriching! Unless the people you're sharing with are idiots. \"You can easily fall into that rabbit hole and find some forum that really isn't relevant but maybe sounds kind of close,\" warned Craig Monsen, co-founder of symptom-checker app SymCat. On the other hand, \"sometimes you'll stumble on exactly the right forum where someone has your same exact problem, and their solution does help.\" \"Health care forums are definitely another tool that individuals can use in order to crowdsource a diagnosis based on their symptoms,\" added Dr. Natasha Burgert of KC Kids Doc. \"I think that these can be a really powerful tool not only for discussing potential diagnosis or symptom relief but also finding a forum of individuals in which you can discuss emotional and psychological parts of an illness and develop a wonderful online support community.\" The trick is to be wary about the issues being discussed in forums and how germane they are to you. And, you know, if people start talking about homemade remedies fashioned from bleach, maybe click off and see a doc. Getting emotional . You know that game \"6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon\"? There should seriously be a version of that called \"6 Degrees of Cancer\" -- as in, when looking up your symptoms online, how long does it take to deduce that you have a life-threatening disease instead of, say, a simple cold? According to Burgert, the root of this whole \"worst-case scenario\" thing is getting too emotional. \"For most intents and purposes, when you're looking for online health information, it's about yourself or a family member,\" she said. \"When you're looking through that lens, it's very hard to keep emotional distance. So you can read about a diagnosis that either makes you very scared or calms your fears -- and that's the path you'll continue down, whether it's correct or not.\" Burgert suggested using online symptom checkers simply to \"understand possible diagnoses, find some initial steps for relieving the symptoms and determine if this is something that needs further evaluation or that can be managed at home.\" SymCat and Mayo Clinic's symptom checker let you type in what you're experiencing and unearth a spectrum of diagnoses and suggestions for when to seek a doctor's aid. Your doctor's website might also have such a tool. Voila, you just increased your separation from cancer by at least a couple of degrees. Keeping mum around MDs . \"I think, traditionally, many physicians are a little apprehensive when that stereotypical patient comes to their office with big stacks of printouts from the Internet,\" Pho said. \"But I think more and more doctors are accepting it. Personally, I think that transparency of information is helpful in a way.\" Translation: Help your doctor help you. If you're worried about a particular medical situation and did some research to help narrow down what's ailing you, share that info with your physician. \"I really appreciate when patients bring in information that they found online, because it allows me to guide my instruction and plan based on their true concerns,\" Burgert said. \"People get scared when they get sick and hurt, and they want to use multiple sources of information to help themselves. The Internet adds to that physician's expertise in order to do that.\" Remember, though, knowing how to use the Internet doesn't make you a doctor. Google doesn't count as a second opinion. If you're unhappy with your doc's diagnosis, go get one the traditional way. Putting off the inevitable . If your ailment isn't going away, all the symptom-checking and Mayo Clinic-ing in the world isn't going to help you. Make a doctor's appointment. Like, right now. Sites like ZocDoc make it super easy (and free; doctors pay to be listed) to set up an appointment ASAP, so no whining that you'll have to wait two weeks to see a doc and maybe by then \"it\" will have gone away. Unless, of course, \"it\" is that white bread you just ate. In that case, please stop calling my dad.\n",

Ever since the superstar songstress released her surprise self-titled album in December 2013, it seems like dropping music with little to no fanfare has become a thing. The latest artist to do so is rapper Kendrick Lamar, whose eagerly awaited sophomore album was set for release March 23. Instead, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" was made available on iTunes and Spotify early Monday. Lamar, who has been hailed as the savior of hip-hop, got a major shout-out from fellow artist Taylor Swift. Among the other artists who've surprised fans: . Drake . The rapper thrilled fans in February when he snuck out \"If You're Reading This, It's Too Late.\" Like Beyonce, he clued fans in via an Instagram post. The 17-track project was billed as a mixtape. The rapper also released a short film titled \"Jungle.\" U2 . The shock in the band's album \"Songs of Innocence\" was not only that it was released but that iTunes subscribers had no choice but to get it. Apple made the album part of an automatic download in October as part of the iPhone 6 announcement. U2 frontman Bono later apologized, and Apple distributed info to customers on how they could delete the album after some complained that the automatic download was invasive. David Bowie . In 2013, the legendary rocker unexpectedly released \"The Next Day.\" It was his first new project in a decade, and fans were thrilled, as the famously private Bowie had been off the grid for a while.

        "input": "Police are investigating a string of suspected arson attacks on three Melbourne Catholic churches with links to paedophile priests. Emergency services were called to a fire at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2am on Wednesday, and police are treating the blaze as suspicious. The church is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased convicted paedophile Father Kevin O'Donnell. Police are investigating whether the blaze is connected to two separate suspicious blazes that were lit on Monday at St James Catholic Church in Brighton and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda, where paedophile priest Ronald Pickering served as minister. Emergency services were called to a fire at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2am on Wednesday, and police are treating the blaze as suspicious . Firefighters extinguished blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street . On Wednesday, it took firefighters 90 minutes to extinguish blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street in Dandenong. Father O'Donnell - who was reportedly known by police as the 'two-a-day man' - was jailed for 15 months in 1995 after he admitted to abusing\u00a010 boys and two girls. He is believed to have committed hundreds of sexual assaults against young girls and boys over the 50 years that he worked in Victorian Catholic churches, before he retired in 1992. He died in 1997. St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong\u00a0is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased Father Kevin O'Donnell . At the Dandenong church in 1958 Father O'Donnell allegedly molested a 15-year-old boy in the presbytery and went on to sexually abuse his brother, sister and friends,\u00a0The Age reported. He presided over the church from 1958 to 1986, before moving onto Oakleigh. On Monday,\u00a0heritage-listed St James Catholic Church in Brighton was mostly destroyed by fire and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda was found with a small amount fire damage to a door. Bishop Peter Elliott told 3AW Catholic churches would be increasing their security, and said he did not believe the fires were lit by sex abuse victims. Australian actress Rachel Griffiths said she was 'quite elated' when she heard the 124-year-old James Catholic church had been destroyed by fire. The Six Feet Under star revealed that like many of the church's former parishioners she found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east. Firefighters desperately tried to battle a fierce blaze that took hold of the building at around 6.30am on Monday morning but it was left gutted. Ms Griffiths told 774 ABC Melbourne the church was plagued by 'tragedy and complicated feelings' and described it as being known locally as 'the haunted house on the hill'. 'We've all attended many funerals of boys that we now know were abused by [Father Ronald] Pickering ... and other perpetrators in the parish - at the actual church that it occurred in,' she said. 'It's been hard for priests to really cleanse this parish, it's been very difficult to rebuild a community and we pretty much all scattered after the revelations came out and found other parishes.' 80 firefighters attended the scene to battle the blaze at St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east . Australian actress Rachel Griffiths is happy that her former Melbourne church has burned down because of its past links to a paedophile priest . Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church because of the sick crimes that historically took place inside it. Her mother stopped taking her to the church after her father left them because Pickering wouldn't have a 'divorced woman in the church'. 'I think that's probably one thing that saved our family that so many of my friends' brothers got involved with,' she said. Ronald Pickering abused boys between 1960 and 1980 while working as a priest in Melbourne . 'We stopped going because he stopped my mother at the door.' At least five people killed themselves after being sexually abused by paedophile priest Ronald Pickering between 1960 and 1980, according to research carried out in 2012. The former priest was named by the Catholic Church in 2013 as being guilty of sexually abusing children. However, after emigrating to Britain in the 1990s he was never brought to justice before he died. One victim, Raymond D'Brass, told a 2013 Victorian government inquiry that Pickering groomed him with cigarettes, money and alcohol. He was abused between the age of 9 and 13 while acting as a choir and altar boy at the church. In his statement at the parliamentary inquiry on March 4, 2013, Mr D'Brass said: 'Over this four-year period I am aware that two other boys were also sexually abused by Father Ronald Pickering. 'I was regularly fondled and petted by Pickering, as were other boys. This occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery. I began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with Pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol, which left me vulnerable to such abuse.' Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church . Photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky . He recalled: 'I now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses, as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication. In 1983, I stopped going to the presbytery after Pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming Sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father. 'He told me that I was not welcome back and that I would burn in hell. Between 1983 and 1987, the two other boys who I know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money, alcohol and cigarettes from Pickering, but I chose not to because I was terrified of him. I have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by Pickering. 'One night after one of the boys paid a visit to Pickering, he attempted suicide. He was unsuccessful on this attempt, but he would go on to successfully commit suicide a short time later.' Many of the church's former parishioners found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton after revelations of child abuse came out . The church is described as a 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church' on its heritage-listed page . The cause of the fire has not yet been established. 'MFB will determine the cause of the fire and then if it's suspicious it will be passed on to police,' a Victoria Police spokesperson said. More than 80 firefighters and 20 trucks were at the scene where the ancient bluestone church was fully alight on Monday morning. A caller to radio show 3AW, named Andrew, said: 'You can hear that in the background, the roof is actually collapsing now.' 20 fire trucks were at the scene of the fire at the ancient bluestone church . Residents watching the fire were cleared from the area because of asbestos.\u00a0And a 10 metre exclusion zone was put in place around the building over fears of structural collapse. MFB spokesperson David Jarwood told the ABC the smoke could be seen from 50 kilometres away. 'It's about 50 by 40 metres apparently the blaze is, the structure, so I'm not surprised people can see a plume from Mornington,' he said. Smoke from the St James Church fire could be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge. An advice notice put out by the MFB said: 'Emergency services are attending to building fire in North Rd Brighton. The area of North Rd and St James Brighton is currently closed and people are advised to avoid the area.' Smoke from the St James Church fire can be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge . The church was built in 1891 and the Parish of Saint James was established a year later. In 1990 a bell tower and bells were installed at a cost of $500,000. The Victorian Heritage Database website said the church 'stands on a site which has great importance in the early history of Catholicism in Victoria as the place where the mission to Brighton was established circa 1854'. It is described as 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church, rectory and church close, mostly dating from the last century but with additions made in 1908 and in the 1920s'. It has an 'unusually elaborate 1934 decoration of the chancel with Roman mosaic flooring, opus sectile tiling and marble altars and rails. The pipe organ by Alfred Fuller of Kew, placed centrally in the rear gallery, is a rare example of his work'.\n",

The terrorists gave no explanation for why they had chosen to free the 19 men and three women, who were packed on a bus in the ISIS-held town of Shaddadeh, and arrived safely at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the nearby city of Hassakeh yesterday afternoon. The news provided a modicum of relief to a Christian Assyrian community that has been devastated by the abductions. But fears remain over the fate of the hundreds still held captive.

But fears remain over the fate of the hundreds still held captive . Captured: The Assyrian Human Rights Network reported the release of the 19 Christians and later published these photographs on its Facebook page . It is not immediately clear why the Islamic State group freed these captives but not more than 200 others . Both Bashir Saedi, a senior official in the Assyrian Democratic Organization, and the Assyrian Human Rights Network reported the release of the 19 Christians.

The Assyrian Human Rights Network, meanwhile, said the captives had been ordered released by a Shariah court after paying an unspecified amount of money levied as a tax on non-Muslims. Known as a jizya, the tax effectively forces Jew and Christians - so-called 'People of the Book' - to either pay a regular sum of protection money to the jihadis, or otherwise choose between forced conversion to Islam or brutal execution. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said a Shariah court had ruled the captives be freed, but the reasoning behind the decision was unknown.

Assyrian leaders and Sunni tribal sheikhs have begun reaching out to ISIS to try to negotiate the release of the captives, activists said. 'We're trying to contact any party that might help. We're working through our friends the tribal sheikhs,' said Younan Talia, a senior official in the Assyrian Democratic Organization. 'Some friends of Daesh are trying to send messages.' Talia said there has been no response yet. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.

Future: Syria's embattled Assyrian Christian community is one the world's oldest Christian groups . The Sweden-based director of the Assyrian Network for Human Rights in Syria, Osama Edward, also said efforts were underway to try to negotiate the captives' release. The abductions have added to fears among religious minorities in both Syria and Iraq, who have been repeatedly targeted by the Islamic State group. During the militants' bloody campaign in both countries, where they have declared a self-styled caliphate, minorities have been repeatedly targeted and killed, driven from their homes, had their women enslaved and places of worship destroyed. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have released sickening footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy.

        "input": "Girls are being over-praised and given higher marks at school for their good behaviour \u2013 not for their ability \u2013 according to a major study (file picture) Girls are being over-praised and given higher marks at school for their good behaviour \u2013 not for their ability \u2013 according to a major study. And this is making life more difficult for them when they enter the jobs market, where rewards are primarily based on what they know, says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It said girls are much more likely than boys to be model pupils. Their diligence and obedience in the classroom is often \u2018rewarded\u2019 with higher marks, while many boys are \u2018punished\u2019 with poor marks for being disruptive. It may mean marks reflect good or bad attitudes to studying, but not necessarily aptitude. The OECD warned that girls who may do better in the short run at school could be \u2018penalised\u2019 in the labour market later on. It called on teachers to review their own \u2018gender biases\u2019 and consider whether marking girls up was really helping them. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD\u2019s director for education and skills, said that even when girls and boys do similarly well in reading and maths tests, girls get better marks. Teenagers with a strong belief in their abilities are more likely to be successful in Britain than in any other country, the study also showed. Those youngsters who were self confident scored higher in maths and science tests, according to analysis by the OECD. And although the pattern is replicated across the world, the effect is more marked in the UK compared to any other country. Meanwhile the research also showed that even though girls outperform boys overall in schools, they are still lagging behing when it comes to maths and science. The report warned: 'What emerges from these anayses is particularly worrying.

Sami, who did not wish to give his last name, had been exchanging input messages with the convicted drug smuggler up until late Tuesday night before the Australian was transferred to Nusakambangan in Central Java from Bali's Kerobokan prison. The friend, who has known Chan since they met in Year 7 at Homebush Boys High in Sydney's west, told 9News\u00a0the Bali Nine ringleader was calm when they spoke through input messaging application, Whatsapp. Scroll down for video . Fellow Bali Nine member Andrew Chan was also onboard the chartered flight to Cilacap . Myuran Sukuraman arrives in Cilacap - the closest port to Nusakambangan - on Wednesday morning local time . A school friend of Chan's (left), who went to Homebush Boys High with him (Chan pictured right as a student), told 9News the Australian had been calm and stayed positive up until yesterday about his impending execution . Sami and Chan had been exchanging input messages on Whatsapp (pictured) up until Tuesday night . 'Even he thought it was never going to happen because he thought we're in the limelight - it'll cool down, it'll be alright,' Sami said. 'So I always said, \"yeah mate, definitely - you're in good hands\".' At least once during their exchange, Chan input him 'all good bro'. Sami added Chan kept positive throughout the ordeal and said: 'I think he [Chan] was really expecting the Australian government to do a lot more.' It comes as it is revealed Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop made a desperate plea to Jakarta officials to swap Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukuraman for three Indonesian drug offenders being held in Australia. Ms Bishop proposed the deal in a 'very tense' phone call with Indonesian foreign affairs minister Retno Marsudi, The Australian\u00a0reported. Earlier this week, Indonesia's human rights commissioner Natalius Pigai (centre) with Sukuraman (left) and Chan (right) It has been revealed Foreign Affair Minister Julie Bishop bargained to have the duo's lives spared in exchange for three Indonesian drug smugglers who were caught with 252 kilograms of heroin in Australia . The pair were taken onto a ship from Cilacap port to Nusakambangan port in armoured car . The port was heavily guarded as Chan and Sukuraman made their way from Cilacap airport on Wednesday morning in Central Java . This is their final journey to Nusakambangan before they will be executed by firing squad . It is tipped they will be killed this weekend and will be given 72 hours notice before it happens . Indonesia has allocated around $20,000 for each prisoner in its 'execution budget' to kill the Australians . The call became so intense that it was feared Ms Marsudi would put a sudden end to the conversation. The prisoners up for negotiation were three Indonesians caught smuggling 252 kilograms of heroin into Australia by sea in 2000. Kristito Mandagiand - who masterminded the plan - was handed the most severe sentence of 25 years without parole for drug smuggling. While the two people who helped him, Saud Siregar and Ismunandar, will spend up to 20 years in prison and can apply for parole in 2017. In exchange for the trio, Ms Bishop wanted Chan and Sukuraman's death sentences reduced to life in prison. Chan's brother, Michael (right), and girlfriend Febyanti Herewila (left) tried to visit the inmate before he was put into an armoured car but were rebuffed by prison officers . Earlier this week, it was thought they would be transferred at midday but officials jumped the gun and bailed the pair out early on Wednesday morning just after 5am local time . Heavily armoured police lined the gates of Kerobokan prison as they prepared for the duo's transfer . Coming through the main entrance, the duo were taken to Denpasar airport where they were flown to Central Java . But the suggestion, which was made during a 30-minute conversation, was not accepted by the government, according to sources. This exchange was offered up after Chan and Sukuraman were transferred from Kerobokan prison - which had been their home for 10 years - after 5am local time on Wednesday. Chan's brother, Michael, and girlfriend, Febyanti Herewila, tried to visit the inmate before he was put into an armoured car but were rebuffed by prison officers. Later that day, Michael Chan told News Corp he was 'devastated' and in shock that his brother's execution was going ahead. Mother of Andrew Chan, Helen (centre), looked downcast as she escorted through Sydney International Airport en route to Indonesia following the pair's transfer . 'I am still trying to register it all. I still can't believe it has happened. I don't even know what to say to be quite frank,' he said. It is not known when Chan and Sukuraman will be executed but Fairfax Media\u00a0is reporting they will be shot dead this weekend. Indonesia's attorney general H.M. Prasetyo is tipped to make an announcement about the time of their deaths on Friday. The pair will be given 72 hours' notice before they are killed by a firing squad at Nusakambangan. Indonesia has allocated about $20,000 for each prisoner in its 'execution budget' to kill the duo. Nusakambangan was chosen as the venue for their deaths because it was cheaper than other locations. Leading up to this month's execution, firing squads have been practising their aim, according to locals . Up to 10 drug traffickers will join Chan (right) and Sukumaran (left) on Nusakambangan .

A struggling\u00a0university is paying up to \u00a3100,000 to send all 700 of its staff for stays at a luxury hotel. The breaks in the Lake District are being organised by the University of Bolton so its controversial vice-chancellor can give pep talks. Professor George Holmes, who was recently lent almost \u00a31million by the university so he could move house, owns a private yacht which is moored less than ten miles from the hotel. The four-star Lakeside Hotel and Spa on Windermere is 70 miles from campus and usually costs about \u00a3220 a night for a room with a view of the lake. The university says the one-night \u2018working residential\u2019 trips, for which it pays all the travel, food and accommodation costs, are an \u2018informative\u2019 and \u2018valuable\u2019 way to discuss strategic aims. It has organised 20 breaks as part of its staff development programme. The first was in September and the last will be in May. Professor Holmes, a former adviser to Labour whose yacht is moored at a marina on Windermere, addresses each group \u2018engaging directly in dialogue in respect of the strategy\u2019. The university, which in 2013 was ranked worst in the country in two guides, said feedback from employees had so far been positive. But according to Times Higher Education, a source at the university said staff were \u2018amazed\u2019 by the scheme because it \u2018must cost a fortune\u2019. A university spokesman said it \u2018considers this an appropriate developmental investment in staff to underpin the growing strength of the university\u2019. The spokesman said it was part of a multi-million-pound investment in teaching and learning infrastructure, adding: \u2018For the avoidance of doubt, the yacht belongs to the vice-chancellor personally and is operated, maintained and moored at the vice-chancellor\u2019s own expense. \u2018The yacht is not university property and has no relevance to the university\u2019s current staff development programme taking place at the Lakeside Hotel.\u2019 The four-star Lakeside Hotel and Spa (pictured) on Windermere is 70 miles from campus and usually costs about \u00a3220 a night for a room with a view of the lake . Last month, it was revealed that the University of Bolton gave Professor Holmes a two-year \u00a3960,000 loan to buy a house nearer the campus without him having to sell his home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The move was to save him a 100-mile round-trip, allowing the 53-year-old, who took up his post in 2006, to \u2018play a greater role\u2019 in the university and the town. Professor Holmes, who in 2013 was paid a \u00a347,200 bonus on top of his \u00a3198,200 salary, bought an imposing Edwardian detached house, described by estate agents as a sublime example of the Arts and Crafts movement. It is understood the \u00a3920,000 property acts as both his personal home and a space to host VIP dinners and events connected with the university. The loan, at a 3.25 per cent interest rate, is due to be paid back once the Wakefield home is sold.\n",

        "input": "An FBI informant sent to infiltrate a California mosque has revealed how his handlers encouraged him to have sexual relations with Muslim women if it meant getting better intel. Craig Monteilh was known to members of the Irvine Islamic Center in Orange County as Farouk al-Aziz, a French Syrian who was a devout and, at times, radical Muslim. However he was really a petty criminal with forgery convictions who was hired by the FBI to go undercover as part of an intelligence surveillance operation after 9/11. Monteilh went public with the operation after his cover was blown in 2007, which exposed some of the government's little-known methods of anti-terrorism policing. Now, in a new interview has given more details about what his mission entailed. Mole: Craig Monteihl, a petty criminal, was recruited by the FBI\u00a0as an informant as part of post-9/11 surveillance operations. He went undercover as a radical Muslim for 15 months at an Orange County mosque . Speaking with HuffPost Live\u00a0on Monday, Monteilh said he was paid to seek out potential threats and gain 'personal information' about such people. Agents sought him out after he spent some time in prison for using fraudulent checks. His mission was to obtain email address and phone numbers of anyone suspicious and get the names of any of their associates, which he would then feed back to his FBI handlers. He also planted some recording devices and was taught 'how to be Muslim', he claims. 'The FBI trained me in the tenets of Islam, in the elementary principles of Arabic, and just to blend into the community and to slowly integrate myself as a Muslim male,' Monteilh told HuffPost Live. However Monteilh's was taken one step further when he claims to have been told to become intimate with some of the women he was mining for information if it meant getting more from them. Scene: Monteilh started attending the Irvine Islamic Center in Orange County (pictured) saying his name was Farouk al-Aziz, a French Syrian who was a devout and, at times, radical Muslim . 'I portrayed myself as a unmarried male, although I was married,' he said. 'Within the Muslim community, they would help me to get a bride, so they would introduce me to single Muslim women. 'I would go out on dates and things like that. '(My FBI handlers) instructed me, if I was getting good intel, to allow it to go into sexual relations.' In a previous interview with The Guardian, Monteilh confirmed he had sex with at least one of the women he was surveying. Monteilh claims he received $177,000 tax free from the government for the 15 months of work he did, which equated to over $11,000 each month. Regret: Monteilh says he now realizes he was motivated by money and was spying on innocent people . Ironically, senior officials at the Irvine Islamic Center contacted the FBI when Monteih started speaking of jihad and plans to blow up buildings as part of an entrapment technique. In 2007 the center filed a restraining order against Monteilh, ending the mission. In retrospect, Monteilh says the money distracted him from what was actually happening. 'I began to be conflicted because I was spying on innocent people. They were not involved in criminal activity,' he said. ' 'They were not espousing terrorist rhetoric, but I was still spying on them and giving the FBI the information they wanted.' After Monteilh went public with what he'd done, the FBI defended its tactics, claiming such operations had prevented further terrorist atrocities in the wake of 9/11. Steven Martinez, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said that in certain circumstances, if there is evidence of a crime, FBI agents may 'conduct an activity that might somehow involve surveillance in and about a mosque.' He added: 'I know there's a lot of suspicion that that's the focus, that we're looking at the mosques, monitoring who is coming and going. That's just not the case.'\n",

        "input": "(CNN)The expulsions of two students by the University of Oklahoma for their role in a racist chant will likely not be the last word on the scandal. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity members can appeal the decision. More students might be expelled. And beyond the immediate issues around the now infamous incident, the university could experience a trickle-down impact for months, maybe years to come. Writing to the two students Tuesday, just two days after a video of frat members singing the racist song surfaced, OU President David Boren said they were being booted for \"leading a racist and exclusionary chant which has created a hostile educational environment for others.\" They were given until close of business Friday to contest the decision. No word yet on whether either will. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said she believes there will be a constitutional challenge to the expulsions. \"It's sort of one of the first things you learn in law school ... you may disapprove of what someone says but you still defend their right to say it,\" she said. Hostin added: \"I think there'll be the arguments that these students were students, and that in our educational systems we want people to have, maybe, even a heightened level of freedom of speech.\" Also unknown at this point is whether other students who appear in the video will be expelled or otherwise punished. Already, the Greek letters sigma, alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house's facade, the house will be closed as of midnight Tuesday and the university will board up the windows, following up on separate decisions by the university and the SAE national headquarters to shutter the Oklahoma chapter, Boren said. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . But he seemed to say that individual punishments could be a bit trickier. \"Well, legally, our concern is we have to demonstrate exactly how the educational experience of our students was threatened or disrupted by their actions,\" Boren said, \"and it really has to focus on the students on the bus. Did the other students have their educational experience disrupted?\" While he unwaveringly declared \"there is no room for racists and bigots\" at his university, the very thing that could keep the SAE fraternity brothers Oklahoma Sooners is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law \"prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance,\" but it also provides the parameters for determining if someone is violating the federal law, Boren said. Any punishment must be \"carefully directed\" if it's to pass constitutional muster, although he made it clear he hopes some of the students involved won't wait for legal issues to be sorted out. \"I think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus, and I hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists,\" he said. So far, no students have dropped out -- voluntarily -- but the video has cost the university's football team a top recruit as offensive lineman Jean Delance said Monday he was de-committing from the Sooners and considering other teams. It's an issue that Ber Thaddeus Bailey, director of diversity, OU student government, worries about. \"I am concerned about the trickle-down effect from this incident,\" he said. \"I do want to encourage those who are considering the University of Oklahoma that this is a great place to study, and we are going to continue to progress.\" CNN's Chris Cuomo contributed to this report.\n",

But a former Knox pupil told Daily Mail Australia one-time headmaster Dr Ian Paterson lived up to that reputation by 'slithering away' while providing evidence at the Royal Commission into Child Sex Abuse on Tuesday. Dr Paterson, the school's headmaster from 1969 to 1998, began the proceedings by reading out a statement apologising to students for what had occurred, accepting responsibility for 'all that occurs during my headmastership'. Further remarks provoked a loud groan from former students, relatives and support personnel watching on when he described an alleged sexual assault victim as a 'drama boy who liked to exaggerate stories' . Scroll down for video . Fronting up: Dr Ian Paterson is pictured after giving evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse . Dr Paterson began today's hearing by apologising for what had occurred under his headmastership . Christopher Fotis, pictured, has vanished following allegations that arose at the child sex abuse inquiry . The 15-year-old victim, known as ASD, had approached Dr Paterson in 1987 to report that teacher and resident housemaster Damien Vance had touched his bottom and made an 'inappropriate sexual suggestion' under the school chapel, the commission heard. 'I'm not aware it was a crime,' the former headmaster told the commission, as he confirmed he had asked the boy to sit in the library while he attempted to investigate the story by questioning Mr Vance. Dr Paterson did not contact the police. 'In light of today, (it is) an extremely serious matter.' On several occasions, a frustrated Dr Paterson, 81, said he did not recall specific details - including what concerns he had about teacher Roger James' relationship with young men. The commission's inquiry into Knox Grammar continues. At Knox years ago, Dr Pateron was an all-powerful figure, according to former students. 'He was the power in the land,' Knox old boy and author Peter FitzSimons told Daily Mail Australia outside the hearing today.\u00a0'He was the Parliament and the King.'

But in the words of a former Knox pupil, one-time headmaster Dr Ian Paterson lived up to that reputation by 'slithering away' from tough questions while providing evidence. The American-educated Dr Paterson's testimony drew considerable interest from former students, after allegations his school had a 'cover-up culture'. Former senior prefect at the school and radio broadcaster Gus Worland told Daily Mail Australia last week: 'We all respected Dr P so much and were scared of him,' said Worland. A former Knox Grammar student onlooker, who attended between 1987 and 1991, was unimpressed by his former headmaster's testimony, which lasted for most of six hours today. \u2018I just have to say, his nickname at school was The Snake,' said the student, who did not wish to be named for fear of offending a friend and a relative.

The former Light Blues player was named as the club's 14th manager earlier in the week and his tenure looked set to get off to the best possible start when Haris Vuckic fired Rangers into an early lead. But Livi hit back through Ibra Sekajja on the stroke of half-time to claim a point. Stuart McCall (right) gestures on the touchline during his first match in charge of Rangers . Rangers players look dejected after Livingston equalised in the Scottish Championship clash . Rangers had been hoping the arrival of McCall would add a much-needed spark to their Scottish Championship promotion push. And the new manager was welcomed into the dug-out by wild applause from an Ibrox crowd of 35,066. McCall made three changes from the side who were held to a home draw by Queen of the South in midweek. Youngster Tom Walsh was handed his first start and Kenny Miller and Sebastien Faure were added to the side. The supporters were cheering again after just nine minutes when Rangers surged into an early lead. Miller's short pass found Nicky Law and he burst forward before setting up Vuckic for a left-foot strike that nestled in the bottom corner.

It had been a bright start from the Light Blues but Livi were gradually allowed to impose themselves on the game. Danny Mullen's 20-yard drive fell just over the crossbar as the division's bottom side tried to haul themselves back into the game. Keaghan Jacobs then teed up Scott Pittman for a shot that deflected narrowly past the post. Rangers could have doubled their lead when the ball broke for Walsh but he hooked just over, before Darren McGregor nodded wide from Law's corner. Gers were left ruing those missed opportunities when Livi levelled on the stroke of half-time. Sekajja reacted quickly to bundle home the rebound after Craig Sives saw his shot crash off the post - then celebrated with a double backflip.

The visitors almost found the back of the net again shortly after the restart, when Mullen unleashed a powerful low drive that fell just wide. Rangers did have the ball in the net after 63 minutes when Nicky Clark's header beat goalkeeper Darren Jamieson but the offside flag was quickly raised. Skipper Lee McCulloch then nodded over from Law's corner as the home side desperately tried to regain the advantage. And Miller was denied only by a great one-handed save as his point-blank header was swatted away by Jamieson.

        "input": "We are constantly being nagged to floss, with dental experts claiming it can add years to our life. But according to one dentist, most of us have been doing it incorrectly for years. Dr Carlos Meulener, a dentist from New Jersey, has released a video showing the best way to floss teeth in order to have the healthiest smile. \u2018Brushing is great but it\u2019s not enough - you need flossing to remove the bacteria between the teeth,\u2019 he says. Dr Calos Meulener has released a video showing his 'one minute flossing technique' which he says helps rid the mouth of bacteria. He is pictured holding floss between two thumbs, about an inch apart . He advises taking a piece of wax dental floss and winding it up with the index fingers, but not so tightly that it hurts. When flossing the upper row of teeth, put the thumbs around an inch apart from each other on the floss. Dr Meulener said: \u2018The reason why most people have a problem flossing is that they try to get too much floss in their mouths. \u2018The way to control it is to use your thumbs for your upper teeth and middle fingers for your lower teeth. \u2018Put that amount of floss between these fingers so you can manipulate it easily from one side to the next.\u2019 Then, put the floss between two teeth and floss in and up and down motion along the teeth, rather than a sawing motion from side to side. 1. Take a piece of wax dental floss and put each thumb about and inch apart . 2. Put the floss between the upper teeth . 3. Keeping the back thumb stationary, move the front thumb up and down to floss the tooth . 4. Do not floss in a 'sawing motion' - back and forth - but up and down, rubbing the floss up and down the tooth . 5. Repeat using the middle fingers for the bottom teeth . \u2018We\u2019re flossing the walls of one tooth and the other tooth and polishing the bacteria off those surfaces,\u2019 Dr Meulener said. One thumb should stay stationary while the other thumb is moved up and down, creating the flossing motion. Similarly, when flossing the lower teeth, one middle finger should stay stationary while the other is moved, it in order to manipulate the floss so it rubs up and down against the inside of the tooth. Dr Meulener says this method, which takes just a minute, is the best and most efficient way to floss. He said: \u2018It takes a minute and it really makes a difference to dental health.\u2019 In the past, studies have shown that flossing teeth can prevent the build up of plaque, which sticks to teeth and causes irritation, inflammation to gums known as gum disease. Gum disease causes bad breath, bleeding gums and, if untreated, cavities, receding gums and tooth loss. Worldwide, 15- 20 per cent of adults aged 35-44 years have severe gum disease, which may result in the loss of teeth. He advises using two thumbs for the upper teeth, or two middle fingers for the lower teeth, and flossing in an 'up and down' motion rather than 'sawing' from side to side . In the UK, the The Adult Dental Health Survey of 2009 found 47 per cent of\u00a0 the population had moderate to severe gum disease - around 30 million people. Research shows losing teeth could signal a higher risk of suffering heart disease and diabetes. Swedish researchers found people with fewer teeth and bleeding gums were more likely to have a range of cardiovascular problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They found poor dental hygiene and bleeding gums could allow up to 700 different types of bacteria to get into the bloodstream, which increases the risk of a heart attack regardless of how fit and healthy the person is. Previous studies have also linked bad teeth to Alzheimer's, heart disease, strokes, diabetes, lung disease and even miscarriage and premature birth.\n",

        "input": "Even by their own self-proclaimed standards, this Sunday on Sky Sports had the prospect of being even more Super than normal. A top of the league clash and a Cup Final saw everybody from the channel involved on the day setting their alarms alarming early, and making their way to Wembley. And it was Neil Ashton who opened proceedings with a special Sunday Supplement from Sky Sports' studio high in the stands. There he welcomed among the guests a new face on the team here, Oliver Holt. And early in the discussion, Ollie proved most prophetic in discussing the game that would take place below them later in the afternoon. With a cup final and a top league clash it was always likely to be a Super Sunday that lived up to its billing . Philippe Coutinho scored a fantastic goal for Liverpool in Sky's first game of the day from Anfield . He acknowledged the Capital One Cup was probably 'bottom of the league for top clubs'. But as he then went on to point out, both ten years and today, for Jose Mourinho and Chelsea 'this competition can act as a catalyst'. Well, as it turned out, we'll now have the opportunity to find out how that pans out. Next up it was Goals On Sunday, during which Chris Kamara very nearly scuppered the Super. During the show, Kammy managed to wrestle himself away from pitch side with Ben Shephard, and went exploring. A very entertaining Paul Robinson then told us about a previous Spurs visit to Wembley under Juande Ramos, before which the usually circumspect boss had arranged a team 'stag do', complete with 'archery, a mock casino... and a shed load of cheese toasties', . During which time Kammy had made his way to the Chelsea dressing room. Here he went on a dizzying tour of the space, where we even got to see the 'tea-making facilities'. So, so far, so good. There was even a great chat with Chelsea kit man Gary Grey who explained that John Terry took his captain's duties so seriously, he was like ' a second kit man'. And that Didier Drogba was a fastidious preparer, who would 'stuff his boots with newspaper'. 'The French paper, L'Equipe', added Gary. Which is where it all started to go wrong. The other guest on the show was Shaun Wright-Phillips, who was also in the dressing room. Reluctantly, he found himself being dragged from his seat by Kammy; 'I don't want to ruin my shoes' muttered the poor fella. To no avail as they went for an impromptu keepy-uppy session which yielded a best total of one. 'You won't see this quality anywhere else', cried Kammy. You'd struggle to argue with that. Luckily, though, the always gregarious co-host redeemed himself later when he produced a knife and fork he'd 'borrowed' from the Bobby Moore Suite to present as a gift to Ben. So at least he'd provided some decent service. The next action came from around 300 miles north of the North Circular with Liverpool welcoming Manchester City to Anfield. Another welcome guest was Gary Neville on Sky Sports' co-commentary who, it has to be said, didn't have much nice to say about his neighbours from up the M62. What's more, he carried on not saying it. As the boys in blue toiled away against the men in red, Gary had no sympathy. 'With the experience they have... I'd be embarrassed', he sighed. And he went on, saying it was also 'painful to watch', and that 'I keep seeing the same mistakes being made. (They're) so easy to play against'. Not much Super going on around those parts for Gary, then. Time to head back to Wembley, where host Simon Thomas and his excellent trio of Jamie Redknapp, Glenn Hoddle and Thierry Henry not only had the run of Wembley, but also a seeming age to fill before kick off. There also appeared to be a mobile analysis buggy that wouldn't play fair, and a stadium PA system they could probably hear back up at Anfield. It all made for a painful build-up. John Terry fires the ball home via a deflection off Eric Dier to put Chelsea in front at Wembley . After the game at Anfield Sky headed back to Wembley to see Tottenham's failed quest for the League Cup . Gary Neville was critical of Manchester City after their 'embarrassing' defeat to Liverpool at lunch time . For their cup final coverage Sky put together a team of Glenn Hoddle, Thierry Henry and Jamie Redknapp . Hoddle kept Henry focused on football as the ex-Arsenal man put in his best peformance since joining Sky . Luckily, though, the boys decamped at kick-off to the studio where the day had begun. Where as the game got under way, things started to get back to nudging Super. All of which was certainly aided at the final whistle by the frequent images we saw of a surprisingly uninhibited Chelsea gaffer, who even managed to take a fall - yet still retain his pride. 'I've never seen him so happy', said Jamie. Even if on interview he was a little more the familiar Jose. 'Celebrations', he agreed were in order, but 'in 20 minutes, over. Goodbye. Training tomorrow'. Things were back to normal for the pundits, too. What's more, I think this was also the best we've seen of Henry since his formal arrival at Sky Sports. With the insightful experience of Hoddle on one side, and the encouraging cajoling of Jamie on the other, Thierry was sharp, punchy and keen as mustard to talk football. With Jamie steering him through from a (thankfully) fully functioning TV monitor, his dissection of Diego Costa's goal was nigh on a masterclass. 'If I'm the striker there', he enthused. 'Happy days!'. Which indeed it was, in the end. Not to mention, even a bit Super.\n",

'He likes challenges, the more responsibility he has, the more he will develop and get better. 'We are very happy to have him; he is doing fantastic things in Europe.

'Our priority is first to have a strong collective, and then as a second step, one outstanding player can naturally differentiate himself and help us to be better. 'The creativity of Brazilian Football is dribbling. Players must have a good attitude, they have to take decisions .

There's no movie yet, but \"Community's\" much-awaited sixth season made its debut. Not even cancellation by NBC could kill the fan favorite sitcom, as Yahoo streamed the first two episodes of the new season early Tuesday. The show appears to have suffered no decline in quality in the move to Yahoo, though cast member Yvette Nicole Brown (now on CBS' \"The Odd Couple\") had to leave the show for family reasons. The premiere briefly touches on this in its own way, with Shirley's absence sounding a lot like the setup for a spinoff (as the character Abed points out, along with several other inconsistencies throughout the episode). The \"new Shirley,\" as Dean joked, is Paget Brewster's Frankie, who exists to play the disapproving authority figure to antagonize the former study group. Soon, the group was running a Prohibition-esque bar before they could learn to live with Frankie. And how about the end of the first episode, which gave us a look at the spinoff, \"The Butcher and the Baker,\" with Shirley and Steven Weber as a Southern lawyer? Episode two got even more out there, with Dean Pelton's adventures in 1990s-style virtual reality and a less-successful plotline involving Britta's parents. Most interesting was the introduction of Keith David as '90s tech genius Elroy. Critics praised the show, with The Hollywood Reporter's Amy Amatangelo saying, \"Everything fans loved about Community remains -- the first two episodes are chock-full of increasingly bizarre pop-culture references (Portuguese Gremlins, anyone?) and meta commentary. The show has seamlessly transferred to an online venue.\" Time's James Poniewozik also liked it (despite some reservations about the plot), writing, \"The first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods, and it does.\" Soon after the show went online, devoted fans on Twitter had their say.\n",

        "input": "Bryan Robson has paid Chris Smalling a huge compliment by likening his recent performances to those of Paul McGrath and Gary Pallister. Five years after signing for United, Smalling is yet to convince many United fans he and Phil Jones are suitable long-term replacements for Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, who left Old Trafford last summer after long and distinguished careers. The 25-year-old has been the object of a few taunts, most recently in the Manchester derby last November when he was sent off in the 39th minute. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling (centre) has impressed Bryan Robson in recent weeks . Robson believes Smalling's passing has been 'crisper' during his displays against Arsenal and Newcastle . Smalling, already on a booking, showed a complete lack of composure by hacking down James Milner in the corner to earn his second yellow and United went on to lose 1-0 against a City team that was there for the taking. Smalling has since shown signs of improvement, though. His commanding performance in last week's 3-0 victory over Tottenham caught Robson's eye and the former United captain thinks that bodes well for Louis van Gaal ahead of Sunday's trip to Anfield. Robson said: 'Chris is a good defender. I have seen him improve over the last few games. 'I even thought against Arsenal and Newcastle away, his passing was a lot better, a lot crisper, so he has come on to a good game, he is in good form at the moment and that will be important at Liverpool.' Smalling kept 26-goal striker Harry Kane quiet last Sunday and the former Fulham man ventured forward, striding confidently with the ball at his feet on a few occasions. The end product was not good enough to suggest Van Gaal has a new Beckenbauer in his squad just yet, but Robson was so impressed by Smalling's confidence that he felt moved to liken the centre-back to two United greats in Pallister and McGrath. Smalling kept a close eye on Tottenham striker Harry Kane during Manchester United's win against Spurs . The former lifted 10 trophies at United and the latter would have won much more than the 1985 FA Cup had he not fought a long-running battle with alcoholism which eventually cost him his place at the club. 'Paul McGrath could do that and so could Gary Pallister,' Robson said when invited to liken Smalling's display to a figure from the past. 'When you keep possession at the back sometimes it's really important that your defenders break past the forwards and they get into the midfield area. 'That means one of your midfield players should be able to get space and I thought Chris did that particularly well against Tottenham and that made it difficult for the Tottenham players.' Smalling seemed pleased to be compared to two defensive stalwarts of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Robson has compared Smalling to former Manchester United defender McGrath . Smalling has also been compared with Gary Pallister (left, pictured with Peter Schmeichel in 1996) 'It's a great feeling know that people are taking notice,' Smalling said. 'I am just hoping I can keep it up and keep a good run and contribute to our results.' Smalling will have to be at his very best again on Sunday at Anfield. Van Gaal has warned the centre-back - and the rest of his team-mates - they must not get sent off in this volatile fixture. As well as pride and bragging rights, a place in the top four is at stake. Liverpool have not lost since they fell 3-0 at Old Trafford in December and a victory for the hosts would move them above United into fourth for the first time since August. Robson thinks victory against Liverpool would deliver a significant blow to the Reds' top-four hopes and is not ruling out a second-place finish for United, who trail City by just two points after their loss at Burnley last weekend. 'Yes, (second) is a realistic target,' the former United captain said. 'We have to play City and Arsenal at home and if we beat both of them all of a sudden your points tally is looking really good. 'When you talk about the top teams it seems as if you look at it like you are going to get beat all the time and the lads have proven that they can perform really well against a top team like Tottenham. 'And a win at Liverpool at this stage of the season would be a fantastic result for us.' Bryan Robson and Chris Smalling were speaking at the launch of bwin Manchester United Casino - the world's first club-based real money casino app which is available now on Android from bwin.com/manutdcasino and will be available soon on iOS through the App Store.\n",

The only theme park to have been completely overseen by Walt Disney himself, Disneyland Park, celebrates 60 years in 2015 and extensive celebrations are planned. A time-lapse video from the Disney archives reveals how the park, which forms half of the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, was built from nothing before its opening on July 17, 1955. Sleeping Beauty Castle at the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California, emerges from scaffolding . The castle at the first Fantasyland, with imitations at all other parks since, in Disneyland in Anaheim . The fun park, the only one of its kind to be fully overseen by Walt Disney, opened on July 17, 1955 . The site was bought in 1953 with construction beginning in 1954 and the grand opening the year after that . The Rocket to the Moon is lifted into place in front of the futuristic Tomorrowland attraction . From an expanse of brown dirt, iconic features such as Tomorrowland's Rocket to the Moon are raised into place while Sleeping Beauty Castle emerges like a turbo episode of Grand Designs. Other original features rising from the earth include the Main Street Train Station's clock tower, the shell for jungle-themed Adventureland and rocky Old West throwback Frontierland. Looking down Main Street USA to the original Fantasyland, Sleeping Beauty's Castle forms perhaps the most iconic image of the park, which emerges like a mini-town in Orange County. Later years have seen the introduction of New Orleans Square in 1966, Critter Country in 1972 and Mickey's Toontown in 1993, followed by an entirely new Disney California Adventure Park in 2001 - together they are now known as Disneyland Resort.

The time-lapse video of the creation of Disneyland looks like a turbo version of Grand Designs . While the idea had been in his thoughts for some time, Walt Disney didn't muck about with the making of the park - purchasing a 160-acre site in 1953, beginning construction in 1954 and opening the year later. Although it was supposed to have been unveiled in a press preview day with about 14,000 invitees on Sunday, July 17, 1955, that opening saw 28,000 people go through the gates due to thousands of counterfeit ticket sales.

I never thought of myself as a racist. I never considered it a possibility. But the bottom line is that the words that were said in that chant were mean, hateful and racist.\" Flanked at the podium by African American leaders who he'd been meeting with at the Fairview Baptist Church in Oklahoma City, Pettit, who is white, said he planned to spend the rest of his life trying to undo the damage he'd done. Pettit's parents released a statement apologizing for his behavior earlier this month. But it wasn't until Wednesday that he spoke out himself. \"Some have wondered why I haven't spoken out publicly. The truth is, I've had a mix of pain, shame, sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions,\" he said. \"I did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country first, until I came here to apologize to the community most directly impacted.\" Pettit read from a letter he'd written the university's president apologizing for his actions and said he's committed to taking steps to prevent racism in the future. \"Over the past week or so, I've met with a number of pastors and leaders in the community to seek understanding of the meaning behind the words that I spoke on that bus,\" Pettit said. \"Meeting with a few people does not change what I did, but it has begun to change me, and my understanding of those hateful words.\" His comments come more than two weeks after a nine-second clip surfaced showing party-bound fraternity members on a bus making racial slurs against blacks. In it, students at the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma clap, pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching. School officials expelled Pettit and another student, Parker Rice, because of their alleged \"leadership role\" in the racist chant. Rice has also apologized, saying he'd made a \"horrible mistake\" and that the chant was \"wrong and reckless.\" Pettit declined to answer reporters' questions Wednesday about how he learned the chant, but said he now knows that the words he used never should be repeated. \"I'm also upset and embarrassed that I failed to stand up as a leader and stop this chant. I now have a clear understanding of what lives behind the words,\" he said. \"From this point forward, I will be the leader that I should have been on that bus and stand up against racism in any form.\" CNN's Faith Karimi, Eliott C.

'The trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch, then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused. 'It just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days. 'In this case, I spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors, but the mother, in particular, still wasn't happy.

        "input": "Natalia Revuelta Clews, the Cuban socialite who emptied her bank account and sold her diamond jewelry to support Fidel Castro when he was a little-known insurgent, has died at age 89. Ms Revuelta, who first caught the eye of the young revolutionary in 1952, opened her home for Castro to plot a barracks assault the following year that is considered the start of the revolution. They later had an affair that produced a daughter, Alina, 59, who as an adult became a harsh critic of the communist leader from exile in Florida. Natalia Revuelta Clews died at the age of 89 on Friday. The green-eyed socialite (pictured in 2003 standing in front of a painting of her youth) supported the insurgency of Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution . Carmen Garcia, Ms Revuelta's caretaker, told The Associated Press that Ms Revuelta died Friday and had been cremated in a private family ceremony. Ms Revuelta's longtime friend Natalia Bolivar, a renowned anthropologist, said Ms Revuelta had been ill after a fall. She suffered a stroke in 2014, according to El Nuevo Herald. Her family could not be reached for comment. She was 'one of the most exquisitely beautiful women in Cuba and a woman with an abnormally sensuous appetite for revolution and adventure,' Georgie Anne Geyer wrote in her biography of Castro, 'Guerrilla Prince.' Born Dec 6, 1925, 'Naty' Revuelta was an only child whose parents divorced when she was a toddler. Her mother remarried when she was 10, to an executive at the US-owned Havana Electric Company. She attended the American-run Ruston Academy in Havana and Mt St. Joseph's Academy, a Catholic girls' school in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania. She also studied business at Marjorie Webster College in Washington before returning to Cuba at 19, working first for the US Embassy and later for Standard Oil. Ms Revuelta was 22 when she married heart surgeon Orlando Fernandez, nearly 20 years her senior. She gave birth to a daughter, Nina, and became a fixture of Havana's social scene. She belonged to the Havana Country Club, played in weekly bridge and tennis tournaments and often lunched at a yacht club. 'Blonde, green-eyed, buxom and always in exuberant spirits, Naty was the kind of woman who stopped eyes and tongues when she entered a room,' Geyer wrote in 'Guerrilla Prince.' But Ms Revuelta was restless. Her husband worked long hours and she was tired of floating from one cocktail party to another, according to Wendy Gimble's 1998 biography, 'Havana Dreams.' Ms Revuelta (left in 2003) and Castro (right, in 1955) became lovers after he was released from prison . The result of Castro and Ms Revuelta's union was daughter Anna Fernandez, born in 1955, who has become a fierce critic of her father. She later fled the island in 1993 (pictured) with a false Spanish passport . She was also unfulfilled by motherhood. Ms Revuelta began attending meetings of the Orthodox Party, which opposed corruption in the government. At the time, Castro, then without his now-famous beard, was married to Mirta Diaz-Balart, whom he met while studying law at the University of Havana. He first laid eyes on Ms Revuelta at a protest marking the anniversary of the 1871 slaying of independence-minded medical students by Spanish soldiers. Castro dispatched a mutual friend who introduced the pair. A few days later, the same friend approached Ms Revuelta, wanting to know if Castro could drop by her house. 'Of course,' she replied. 'After five o'clock, I'm always home.' 'He was the kind of person who couldn't be ignored. If he was in a room, people paid attention to him,' Revuelta told\u00a0US News and World Report in 1999. 'I too had a certain charm of my own.' Castro was briefly jailed soon after for leading an underground movement against strongman Fulgencio Batista, and he didn't turn up at Ms Revuelta's for months. But after he did, her home became a key planning area for the attack on the Moncada army barracks in eastern Cuba. Ms Revuelta was 'one of an extraordinary contingent of beautiful and/or highly intelligent women who, in effect, dedicated their lives to (Castro) and his cause,' Tad Szulc wrote in Fidel: A Critical Portrait. She handed over all of her savings of 6,000 pesos \u2014 then worth the same amount in dollars \u2014 to support his movement, and later pawned her sapphires, emeralds and diamond jewelry for his cause. She sewed fatigues for his rebels to wear, and delivered Castro's uprising manifesto to top Havana newspaper editors. Ms Fernandez (left) went back to Cuba for the first time in years last August after her mother became seriously ill (file photo) Ms Revuelta, who had plans on becoming First Lady of Cuba, said she wasn't bitter that Castro (pictured in the 1960s),\u00a0put his revolutionary project ahead of his personal life . The 1953 barracks assault failed, with most of the rebels killed and the rest captured. Ms Revuelta wrote to Castro frequently when he was in prison. She sent him scores of books by Dostoevsky, Freud, and Hugo and an envelope of sand to remind him of the beach. Castro's prison love letters to Ms Revuelta are one of the few glimpses into his closely guarded emotional side: 'I am on fire. Write to me, for I cannot be without your letters,' he wrote in 1954. 'I have been meaning to ask you for several days now to stop using the typewriter once . in a while and write longhand . . . I love your handwriting, so delicate, feminine, unmistakable,' he wrote. The rebel and Diaz-Balart divorced, in part because one of his letters to Ms Revuelta was mistakenly delivered to his wife. Castro was freed, and he and Ms Revuelta became lovers for what she said was the first time. She became pregnant, though she didn't tell Castro until after he had fled to Mexico later that year. Castro then asked Ms Revuelta to come to Mexico and marry him, but she refused, convinced he would not survive. Alina was born in March 1956, six months before Castro returned to Cuba and took to the Sierra Maestra mountains. Castro did not recognize his daughter, and Ms Revuelta's estranged husband gave her his last name. The future Cuban leader eventually told Alina at 12 she could become a Castro, but by then she didn't want to, according to her memoir. Castro's rarely seen emotional side is visible in letters to Ms Revuelta from prison in which he says he is 'on fire.' Above, the former president meets Cuban spies returned in a deal with the US . Ms Revuelta said that ''it took many years' to get Castro out of her heart because he was omnipresent on state television and print media . After Castro's forces toppled Batista, Revuelta quietly began preparing for a role as Cuba's first lady \u2014 but it was not meant to be, as Castro kept his distance. She and her husband divorced in 1959, and he took their daughter Nina to the United States. Ms Revuelta never remarried, lost her home to nationalization and became active in Cuba's new civilian militias. Alina Fernandez Revuelta fled the island in 1993 disguised as a Spanish tourist \u2014 an escape Revuelta only learned about from US radio reports \u2014 and later wrote articles blasting his communist government. In August 2014, Ms Fernandez Revuelta returned to Cuba for the first time to see her ailing mother, the Miami Herald reported. Though her contact with Castro was minimal through the years, Ms Revuelta remained in Cuba and was a regular at embassy cocktail parties, stylish and bejeweled with her ever-present gold-plated cigarette case. In 2008, Revuelta told the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia that she was never bitter that Castro 'put his revolutionary project ahead of his personal life.' The beauty said that it was difficult to avoid him, given that he was constantly on the television 'everywhere, every day.' She said, 'it took many years to get him out of my heart.' The former Cuban president, 88, now only makes infrequent public appearances, and has been rumored as deceased several times. He recently met with members of the Cuban Five spies, who had been held in Miami since 1998 until a recent warming in relations between the US and Cuba led to the release of three. Castro has at least seven other children with three other women. He resigned as president in 2008. His brother Raul now holds the post and announced a landmark deal with the President Barack Obama in December.\n",

Matt Sandusky, 36, officially changed his last name after revealing he was abused during the 2012 sex crimes trial that resulted in a 45-count conviction for his adopted father. He is keeping the new last name secret to make life in State College, the home of Pennsylvania State University and the Nittany Lions football team, easier on his wife and four children. Scroll down for video . Matt Sandusky (above) officially changed his last name after revealing he was abused during his father's trial . Jerry Sandusky was found guilty of 45 counts of sex crimes against young boys and is serving 30-60 years . Matt, 36, refuses to speak his 71-year-old father's name and simply refers to him as 'my perpetrator' Matt, who claims he's 'not mad' about the situation, does sometimes use his hold last name when he speaks on behalf of Peaceful Hearts, his nonprofit organization, according to Bleacher Report. He started the foundation with his second wife Kim to help victims of childhood sexual abuse. Matt said: 'With the foundation, I'm Sandusky. 'Because, like it or not, people identify the name with everything that happened. 'And that's important to the cause.' Even though Matt will speak about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father, he refuses to say his name and simply calls him 'my perpetrator'. Matt started the Peaceful Hearts foundation with his wife Kim to help victims of childhood sexual abuse . Sandusky was an assistant coach under Hall of Fame Penn State Football coach Joe Paterno (pictured . Penn State football is part of life in State College and fans of the program are known for their dedication . Jerry Sandusky, 71, is serving a de facto life sentence, 30-60 years, at State Correctional Institution Greene maximum security prison. He claims to be innocent.

Matt was\u00a0placed in foster care with the Sandusky family in January 1995. and adopted after he turned 18. After revealing Sandusky's abuse, Matt was paid a civil settlement by Penn State. Dottie Sandusky, Jerry's wife, has always maintained her husband's innocence. Another one of their adopted sons, 39-year-old Jeff, also says his father is innocent. Given coach\u00a0Paterno's legendary status in State College, some residents and football fans did not take kindly to Matt revealing what had happened to him. That was one of the reasons Kim and Matt picked out a new last name in August of 2013. According to Kim, Matt's four children\u00a0(three with his first wife) were being hassled due to their surname. She said: 'The bullying was very bad. 'So as a family we decided to start new and let the kids avoid being stigmatized.' Coach Paterno's legendary status in State College led to Matt's four children being bullied at school . They did consider leaving, but opted to stay because 'there are a lot of caring people here', according to Matt. As of now, he plans to stay in State College and continue to spread his message. He said: 'Child sexual abuse impacts so many Americans and yet we do far too little about it. 'If that can change, I'll feel like this has all been a worthwhile journey and I can feel real pride.'\n",

Neil Tregarthen devoted six weeks to gathering information for a 15-page report that named their prime suspect \u2013 but officers dismissed it as \u2018rumour and speculation\u2019 and abandoned the case. Yesterday the millionaire former business owner \u2013 who posed as an angler at one stage to spy on youths he believed were responsible \u2013 criticised the police investigation as \u2018totally impotent\u2019. Scroll down for video . Neil Tregarthen spent \u00a310,000 on a private investigator after his daughter's cat, Farah, was shot by an air rifle . He and the private eyes identified several members of a local gang that posted Facebook pages of themselves injuring animals, and had criminal records for air rifle related offences. But police refused to bring a prosecution because of \u2018lack of evidence\u2019 for an attack that condemned Farah the kitten to a slow, agonising death. Mr Tregarthen\u2019s daughter Aylish was horrified to find Farah lying in a pool of blood after limping home wounded and crippled with pain last September. The 24-year-old medical student and her father took the kitten to a vet but she suffered \u2018a very long, painful, lingering death\u2019 from a ruptured bowel and blood poisoning, finally passing away on the operating table, Mr Tregarthen said. When police told him there was not enough evidence to pursue the case he hired the detective firm and offered a \u00a31,000 reward to catch the killer. They distributed flyers and set up a phone line for people to give information. It quickly became clear there had been a string of air rifle attacks near where Aylish lives in Exeter, Devon. \u2018We narrowed it down to four youths, so we set about doing surveillance work,\u2019 Mr Tregarthen said. \u2018We would camp out on the river pretending to be fishing. We surveyed certain areas by pretending to be members of the public. Ideally we needed to witness an incident, but that never happened. We found a witness who claimed he had witnessed our main suspect shooting another cat.\u2019 The kitten, pictured right with one of the family's other pets, died despite extensive treatment at the vets . Mr Tregarthen is offering \u00a31,000 to anyone with information which could lead to Farah's killer. The kitten was shot near her owner's home in Exeter . Exeter-based Focus Investigations, whose staff includes ex-police officers, said the person responsible had \u2018an obvious sociopathic nature\u2019. Mr Tregarthen, 56, added: \u2018We compiled all the information we had, and presented it to the police. We did 85 per cent of the work \u2013 then Devon and Cornwall Police would not even go and knock on a couple of doors. Using an air rifle to shoot cats is illegal, and should be treated as such.\u2019 Mr Tregarthen, who lives in a luxury house in Truro, Cornwall, said of the cost of his own investigation: \u2018I would pay double that if I thought it would stop this sort of behaviour. 'I know I am in a fortunate position to be able to do so, but I think it is money well spent. It\u2019s about society fighting back.\u2019 Mr Tregarthen enlisted the help of private investigators Focus (offices pictured above) to help find Farah's killer . The animal is likely to have been playing in the garden when killed, Mr Tregarthen said. She returned to Miss Tregarthen's house wounded . His daughter said: \u2018I feel like there is no justification for not investigating something that is illegal. We sympathise with the budget cuts \u2013 they have limited time and resources, which is why we chose to investigate it. But to still have the same response is very disappointing.\u2019 Devon and Cornwall Police neighbourhood beat manager Steve Parsons said: \u2018We investigated this crime fully. As for the investigation report, I have examined this and it is packed with rumour and speculation, not evidence. \u2018However, on the back of this, officers did make further inquiries in the area which also turned out to be fruitless. I am confident we have done everything possible in investigating this case.\u2019 Mr Tregarthen said police were 'impotent' in their investigations into who killed the cat, pictured above in a red collar .

The retired neurosurgeon posted a statement on his Facebook page just hours later in which he said he 'realized that my choice of language does not reflect fully my heart on gay issues.' 'I do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation. I regret that my words to express that concept were hurtful and divisive. For that I apologize unreservedly to all that were offended,' he added. Scroll down for video . Republican presidential hopeful Carson has been forced to apologize for comments on Wednesday in which he claimed that prisoners' changing their sexuality in jail proves that being gay is a choice . However Carson's apology only went so far and he remains adamant that it isn't certain whether people are born either gay or straight. 'Some of our brightest minds have looked at this debate, and up until this point there have been no definitive studies that people are born into a specific sexuality,' he said. Carson's opinion is at odds with many in the medical community, including the American Psychological Association, who says 'most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.' Carson had landed himself in hot water on Wednesday morning after appearing on CNN's New Day.\u00a0Asked by Chris Cuomo if being gay was a choice, Carson replied: 'Absolutely.' 'Because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight - and when they come out, they're gay. So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question,' Carson said. He then spoke out against gay marriage. 'Why do gay people want to get married? Why do they say they want to get married? Because they want to have various rights - property rights, visitation rights,' he said. Carson's apology only went so far and he remains adamant that it isn't certain whether people are born either gay or straight . 'Why can't any two human beings, I don't care what their sexual orientation is, why can't they have the legal right to do those things? That does not require changing the definition of marriage.' Carson said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level, this on the same day the Alabama Supreme Court ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. Carson has long been outspoken on the subject of gay marriage, which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech. In an interview with Sean Hannity, Carson said; 'My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn't matter what they are.' He continued by saying; 'They don't get to change the definition. It's not something that is against gays, it's against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society. It has significant ramifications.' The comments came as a shock at the time as up to that point Carson has come across as an affable and moderate Republican in a series of interviews. The backlash was so strong, especially among young Americans, that Carson was forced to withdraw from delivering the commencement address at his alma mater Johns Hopkins. Earlier this week Carson launched an exploratory committee to run for president, becoming the first high-profile Republican candidate to potentially enter the 2016 race.\n",

Wirts flashed a Vulcan salute aboard the International Space Station. As the weekend went on, billboards from the company Outfront Media (formerly CBS, owners of \"Star Trek\") showed up around Atlanta. Longtime friend and co-star William Shatner remembered Nimoy \"like a brother.\" George Takei wrote, \"Today, the world lost a great man, and I lost a great friend.

The outpouring on Twitter and elsewhere left no doubt about Nimoy's indelible mark on pop culture. Nimoy's career also inspired some of the most brilliant minds in space and science. NASA posted a 1979 photo of Nimoy and the \"Star Trek\" cast -- some sporting '70s leisure suits -- visiting the space shuttle Enterprise.

Michelle Carter, 18, was indicted on February 5. Conrad Roy, 18, of Fairhaven and Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, was found dead in his car of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning on July 13, Sgt. Kevin Kobza, public information officer for the Fairhaven Police Department, said Saturday. At one point the night of Roy's death, he exited the vehicle and communicated to Carter that he was having second thoughts about taking his own life, Kobza told CNN. Carter then urged him via input message to get back in the car, Kobza said. Upon searching Roy's cell phone, police discovered \"hundreds\" of inputs between Roy and Carter, many which contained language from Carter that encouraged Roy to take his own life, Kobza said. \"Instead of attempting to assist him or notify his family or school officials, Ms. Carter is alleged to have strongly influenced his decision to take his own life, encouraged him to commit suicide and guided him in his engagement of activities which led to his death,\" Gregg Miliote, director of communications for the Bristol County District Attorney's Office, said in a statement. Carter's lawyer, Joseph Cataldo, said Saturday that the evidence will show this was not manslaughter and that Carter attempted to console Roy on \"many occasions.\" \"The facts that have been given out to the public at this point put her in the worst possible light,\" Cataldo said. \"My heart goes out to the family, but this was a young man who planned this for months and months.\" On a Twitter page confirmed by the District Attorney's Office to be Carter's, several photos and tweets about Roy have been posted since his death. One tweet reads, \"I can't believe today already marks 4 months without you. I love you and miss you always Conrad...\" In September 2014, Carter organized a softball tournament in Roy's memory and raised $2,300 for mental health awareness, according to Kobza. Carter was arraigned on the indictment on February 6 in New Bedford Juvenile Court, released on $2,500 bail and told not to use social media, according to Miliote. Carter was indicted as a youthful offender because she was not yet 18 when the alleged crimes occurred. Youthful offenders are tried in juvenile court but the proceedings are public, Cataldo said. Because of a familial relationship he has with the victim's family, Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn recused himself from the investigation and prosecution of this case, the District Attorney's Office said. Carter's pretrial hearing is set for April 17.\n",

Subs not used: Zaluska, Scepovic, Fisher, McGregor. Goals: Commons 28, Forrest 79 . Referee: Bobby Madden . Attendance: 49,259 . MOTM: Nir Bitton. Celtic were ahead at the time. They had exploited their opponents being down to 10 men when skipper Sean Dillon collided with Virgil van Dijk and left the pitch in 23 minutes to receive stitches. He was gone for fully eight minutes. \u2018I was about to make a change because it seemed to be taking too long,\u2019 said manager Jackie McNamara afterwards. \u2018It proved costly for us. \u2018I had Blair Spittal ready to come on and I was going to put Ryan McGowan to right-back. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a magic wand for those circumstances.\u2019 Dillon would eventually leave the pitch on a permanent basis in the second half for a reckless challenge on Emilio Izaguirre in 56 minutes. Thereafter, Celtic dominated, scoring again through James Forrest and emphasising why the Tayside club were so willing to wait for their captain when he left the pitch for lengthy treatment. He wasn\u2019t to blame for the insipid Paul Dixon free-kick which allowed Craig Gordon to gather and trigger a Celtic counter. But it was from his position that Anthony Stokes \u2013 who had a fine game - chipped a left-foot cross that was prodded towards goal by Kris Commons, changing direction as it came off the inner thigh of Jaroslaw Fojut. Somehow Rado Cierzniak in the United goal clawed it brilliantly on to the post, but Commons would not be denied, thumping the rebound emphatically into the net with his right foot for 1-0. \u2018Hindsight is a wonderful thing,\u2019 pondered McNamara. \u2018If we had scored from that Dixon free-kick, everyone would be saying it was a great decision not to substitute him and give him a little more time.\u2019 There was more cause for United regret in 36 minutes when Ryan Dow, chasing a through ball into the area was pushed in the back by Brown, a villainous figure through Tannadice eyes. Referee Madden had a good, long look then decided to turn the other way. Brown had ducked SFA punishment last weekend and here was the cause of another Tannadice gripe against authority. Not without justification, it should be said. James Forrest curls in the second goal for Ronny Deila's side as the Scottish Premiership leaders proved their superiority at Hampden Park . John Guidetti (left), on loan from Manchester City, celebrates Forrest's strike for The Hoops as they beat Dundee United . Celtic manager Ronny Deila urges his side to remain focused as they continue to chase a domestic treble . Forrest roars in celebration with the Celtic fans at Hampden Park erupting after Deila's team prevailed 2-0 in the Scottish League Cup final . Predictably, Deila \u2013 perhaps seeing it through green and white shades \u2013 saw things differently. \u2018It was hard to say, but, from what I have been told, it was a good decision,\u2019 he claimed. \u2018I think the referee was very good. We are after him whenever he does something wrong, but you have to give them credit when they do a good job.\u2019 In contrast, United foamed with frustration and knew they were done for when they went down to 10 men in 56 minutes. Last Sunday, Paul Paton and Dixon were sent packing. Paton\u2019s proved to be a nonsense, but Dillon\u2019s here was inarguable. The defender lunged into a dangerous challenge on Izaguirre. The Honduran was fortunate to escape serious injury. On the United touchline McNamara raged with the perceived injustice of it all. His side had lost the Scottish Cup Final against St Johnstone last May and they knew, now, another showpiece occasion was slipping away. Celtic\u2019s extra man was telling. Dundee United captain Sean Dillon (right) is sent off for this late challenge on Celtic defender Emilio Izaguirre . Dillon can't hide his devastation after the Dundee United captain was sent for an early shower having been sent off at Hampden Park . In Stokes, Stefan Johansen and Nir Bitton, they had the best players on the pitch. In 67 minutes, Johansen got across Fojut to jab a Leigh Griffiths cross towards goal, the ball shaving the post en route to a narrow United escape. It was the last act for Griffiths before he made way for John Guidetti. James Forrest replaced the tiring Commons and the substitutes would make quite an impact. Forrest and Guidetti started brightly enough, the winger sweeping the critical second goal into the net from 16 yards in 78 minutes after the Swede teed up a Johansen cut-back. Their manager was less impressed with the very public falling out as the two haggled over a penalty kick five minutes from time. Kris Commons managed to fire Celtic ahead from an acute angle during the first-half, as Deila (right) roars in celebration . Commons put The Bhoys ahead on the half hour mark with his 11th goal of the season in all competitions with Celtic . Commons is congratulated by his team-mates having put the Scottish Premiership leaders in front during the League Cup final . Referee Madden showed no hesitation when Forrest was pulled back by Dixon. \u2018He was very quick to point to the spot that time,\u2019 said a caustic McNamara afterwards. Forrest grabbed the ball, resisting Guidetti\u2019s determined and very vocal efforts to do the same. The winger placed the ball down, then placed a weak effort too close to Cierzniak, the United keeper preventing a third goal. An unimpressed Deila explained afterwards: \u2018Both of the players who were going to take a penalty, Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons, were off the park. It looks like it was the first to the ball, but I don\u2019t like that they argue about that. Forrest earned Celtic a penalty late on under this challenge from Dundee United's Paul Dixon in the closing stages . Several Celtic players wanted Guidetti to take the spot-kick but Forrest insisted and eventually missed his penalty . \u2018It is stupid. That is not the team spirit I want.\u2019 As the final whistle signalled a significant day for the Norwegian, Guidetti marched straight down the tunnel in a huff, clearly furious. He was retrieved by Mikael Lustig, possibly on Deila\u2019s orders. \u2018There is a lot of emotion in these situations and strikers, especially, want to score goals,\u2019 he continued. \u2018Again, we have to put the team in front of ourselves. It is something we have work on all the time and learn from through experience. This is not team spirit. It is individual thinking - and I don\u2019t want anything to do with that.\u2019 Collectively, Celtic have much to excite them. A Treble hovers on the horizon. The late night celebrations can wait.

        "input": "(CNN)He doesn't wear a uniform or hold an official rank, but Hadi Al-Amari is a powerful military leader in Iraq. He leads the Hashd Al-Shaabi, a predominantly Shia paramilitary force doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take Tikrit from ISIS extremists. Ousting ISIS from Tikrit is important for dozens of countries in the United States-led coalition trying to thwart the Islamist extremist group's quest to grow its caliphate. Iran isn't a part of this coalition, but it is also working to defeat ISIS -- something that's provoked both relief and alarm in Washington. Al-Amari is confident his men, with help from the Iraqi army and some Sunnis, can crush ISIS in Iraq without this coalition's help. He's sure because the Iranians are advising them. \"We don't need it, and we won't need it,\" he said. \"Anyone who puts their faith in the international coalition to liberate Iraq is putting their faith on a mirage.\" Iran knows what it's doing, in his view. \"Yes, we declare to the world, we have Iranian advisers, and we're proud of them, and we thank them deeply for participating with us because Iran has more experience than anyone else on Earth in fighting terrorism.\" Does it matter that Iran is advising militias fighting ISIS? Does it matter which countries are taking part in the fight against ISIS -- including that one of them, Iran, is a longstanding U.S. foe? When asked questions along those lines Wednesday in Washington, it seemed that even top U.S. military officials didn't have easy answers. The view is that defeating ISIS is good, while relying on and possibly strengthening Iran is not. In other words, Iran's involvement in Iraq is a mixed blessing. To make sense of this all, one needs to understand not only the international landscape and Iraqi politics, but Islam itself. The religion's two major sects are Sunni and Shia. In Iraq, Sunni Arabs comprise 15% to 20% of Iraq's population, with about half of them in urban areas like Baghdad, Mosul and Tikrit, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. About 18% of Iraq's population is Sunni Kurds. That means the vast majority of Iraqis are Shiite Muslims. And it matters. During his decades-long rule, Saddam Hussein -- a Sunni whose hometown is Tikrit -- gave positions of power to Sunnis, and marginalized Shiites, experts say. Many Shiite families fled to Iran and the country gave them housing and jobs and schooled their children. That imbued Iraqi Shiites who have returned home with a fierce allegiance to Iran. Shias have led Iraq since Hussein's ouster, often alienating Sunnis in the process. This has fueled major sectarian rifts that peaked when Nuri al-Maliki was prime minister, leading to not only millions of disaffected citizens but a weaker central government and military that ISIS frequently overran in 2013 and 2014. Haider al-Abadi took over as Prime Minister last year in part to address these deep divisions. Still, some Sunnis haven't seen the change they want: For instance, Sheikh Naim al-Gaoud in February called for direct U.S. arming of Sunni tribes like his or at least pressure to make Iraq's government help them more in the fight for Anbar province. And Shiite militias sometimes have done more to hurt than help the cause of unity. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch has documented what it calls escalating \"abuses by militias allied with Iraqi security forces in Sunni areas,\" pointing to instances in which residents have been forced from their homes, kidnapped and executed. Such treatment has happened in remote areas as well as the Iraqi capital, according to the group. \"Sunnis are a minority in Baghdad, but they're the majority in our morgue,\" an Iraqi Health Ministry doctor told Human Rights Watch last July. Just a few days ago, Iraq's most powerful Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said people \"must always act with self-control,\" according to the New York Times. Still, there's hardly a guarantee such calls for restraint will be answered, especially amid the chaos of war. The fear is that mostly Shia militias, like the one led by al-Amari, will inflame the tinderbox of sectarian strife -- with Human Rights Watch warning of revenge attacks on Sunnis in Tikrit. Add to this equation the fact that ISIS is made up Sunni Muslims who consider Shias heretics and apostates, slaughtering them in large numbers. Civilians and troops alike have faced their wrath: The most glaring incident may have been last June, when the militant group overran an Iraqi military base once known as Camp Speicher -- which, notably, is near Tikrit -- and claimed to kill some 1,600 air force cadets, the vast majority of them Shias. Given these harsh realities, it's not necessarily cut and dried what a Sunni citizen in Tikrit will think if either Shia militias or the Shia-led Iraqi military battle the Sunni group ISIS. \"Do I choose the Iraqi military (which is working with the U.S.-led coalition) or ISIS? Do I choose leukemia or the plague? ... Which groups do they dislike more?\" said Stephen Biddle, a strategy expert and the award-winning author of \"Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle.\" \"It's not like the Sunnis love ISIS; most don't. But some think the Shiite government is a bigger threat than ISIS.\" So what should the United States do? Jessica Stern, a lecturer on terrorism at Harvard University who this month published, \"ISIS: The State of Terror,\" says it's imperative to address the sectarian divisions in Iraq and continue pushing for changes in its government. She notes that \"the anti-Sunni, Shia-promoting government of Maliki\" was a big reason ISIS was able \"to take root\" in Iraq. \"Many Sunnis feel under siege. ISIS is saying, 'We're going to protect you. ISIS is presenting itself as a savior of Sunnis,\" she said. But, as Biddle points out, reform in a bureaucracy comes slow. There's been talk for years about healing Iraq's sectarian divide. What's to say talk will translate into action anytime soon? Biddle thinks the U.S. should consider sweetening the carrots offered to the Iraqis as incentives -- and start carrying bigger sticks -- to spur it to get its act together. The biggest stick would be pulling out of the fight against ISIS. \"Right now we seem to be limping along with whatever they do,\" he said. \"We're not offering them many goodies to do what we want and not making them feel like they're going to suffer much either if they don't do what we want.\" Enter Iran. It's part of this quandary because it shares a border with Iraq, has its own interest in fending off ISIS, and is predominantly Shia. It's also a staunch foe of the United States, which its leaders have cast as the \"Great Satan.\" That lack of love is mutual, with Washington leading a years-long standoff with Tehran over its nuclear program. (There are ongoing talks aimed at resolving that impasse, but critically no deal yet.) Yet ISIS is likewise America's enemy, with President Barack Obama saying that the goal is to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" that group. It's not in Iran's interest to have Iraq devolve into a sectarian war, says retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst. \"The Iranians are smart enough to know that's a possibility, so they would be telling the Shia-led militias not to make this a Sunni v. Shia fight,\" Francona said. But what should the United States think about Iran's efforts to defeat ISIS by backing Shia-led militias? Speaking at a congressional hearing Wednesday about the White House's request for use of force to fight ISIS, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff opined that Iran's involvement in helping Iraqi forces is a good thing. \"Anything anyone does to counter ISIS is in the main a good outcome,\" Gen. Martin Dempsey said. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter suggested that the matter was more nuanced. The U.S. is worried about Iran's role, he said. \"It is something that is concerning to us,\" he said of Iran's role, \"in particular because the sectarian danger in Iraq is the principal thing that can unravel the campaign against ISIS.\" CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.\n",

        "input": "(CNN)Lily wasn't moving when rescuers found her, hanging upside down in her mother's smashed car. It had flipped over into a frigid Utah river half a day before, and the baby was still strapped in her seat. As Officer Jared Warner dashed with the 18-month-old in his arms to an ambulance, she was barely alive. But she's doing better, her family said Monday. \"Her improvement is astounding. Right now she's watching 'Dora (the Explorer)' and singing '(The) Wheels on the Bus' with Grandpa. She is smiling and laughing for family members. We're blown away by Lily's progress and so grateful to her rescuers,\" they said. Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. She was 25 years old. Lily might have died unseen with her mother, had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. \"Where the car was, you couldn't see it from the roadway,\" police Lt. Cory Slaymaker said. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. Police and fire rescuers arrived and sprang into the water. The rest of what happened is now a frenetic blur for Officer Bryan DeWitt. \"I don't remember doing anything but just doing it,\" he said. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Then they noticed the baby. \"She was definitely unconscious and not responsive,\" Warner said. But she was still alive, and rescuers were delighted to see it. She was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred when police believe it did. The night before, a man living nearby heard a loud crash and stepped outside to check, but he saw nothing unusual, police said, and dismissed it. That was at about 10:30 p.m. on Friday. Groesbeck's car had probably just struck a bridge embankment. \"The driver's side tire went up the cement barrier on the south end of the bridge, launching this woman and her baby into the freezing water,\" Slaymaker told CNN affiliate KUTV. The angler came along around 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, 14 hours later. Groesbeck's death is tragic, but the survival of baby Lily is a story filled with hope. But just how did the baby survive the ordeal? Above all, said CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, the biggest factor was the car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat and the seat appears to have been properly attached, Cohen said. Even though the child was trapped and upside down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but would be even more so if the baby were wet. Dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures, Cohen said. Another factor may have been that the girl, as a toddler, has baby fat. If she had been an infant, it might have been a different story, Cohen said. It's a reminder that the human body is tough. Lily apparently survived for 14 hours in extreme cold, without food or drink. A mystery arose from the rescue: The police officers who entered the water say they heard a voice calling for help. The mother was dead, but the officers said that they heard an adult's voice calling to them. \"The four of us heard a distinct voice coming from the car,\" Warner told CNN. \"To me, it didn't sound like a child's voice.\" The voice gave the rescuers a surge of adrenaline needed to push the vehicle upright, he said. The mother was dead. The child was unconscious, but her eyelids were fluttering, and the rescuers knew she was alive, Warner said. It's one of those things that doesn't have an explanation, he said about the voice. \"It felt like I could hear someone telling me, 'I need help,'\" DeWitt told CNN affiliate KSL. \"It was very surreal, something that I felt like I could hear.\" Tyler Beddoes, a third officer at the scene, said the same. \"All I know is that it was there, we all heard it, and that just helped us to push us harder, like I say, and do what we could to rescue anyone inside the car,\" he told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360.\" The river is 10 feet deep in some places, police said, but the car hit a shallower spot. Images showed it only partly covered by water. Lily was not submerged, said Police Lt. Matt Johnson. Firefighter Paul Tomadakis freed her from the wreck. He \"grabbed the baby in my arm, raised its head up out of water, as I tried to release the seat belt,\" he said. Then Warner took Lily into his arms. \"The child was passed to me and I ran up and climbed into the ambulance with the child,\" he said. Police have no explanation for the wreck. No alcohol or drugs were in play, they told KUTV. There were no skid marks leading up to the impact. A tow truck hauled Groesbeck's car out of the river, and it will be inspected for possible mechanical failures. Groesbeck's family has set up a gofundme page for donations to help with medical expenses for Lily, and funeral costs for her mother. Late Monday, it had reached more than $35,500, surpassing its goal of $8,000. CNN's Melanie Whitley, Vivien Kuo, Elizabeth Cohen, Joe Sutton Jackie Castillo and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.\n",

        "input": "Ellen Pao, 45, accused venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers of discriminating against her other female colleagues in a $16m suit . The CEO of Reddit has told a court how she was pursued 'relentlessly' by a male colleague at a major venture capital firm before being frozen out after breaking off the affair. Ellen Pao is seeking $16million after filing a sex discrimination suit against prestigious Silicon Valley business Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers. The 45-year-old told jurors how she was excluded from an all-male dinner with Al Gore and felt 'very uncomfortable' hearing male guests of the firm talking about pornography on a private jet. In her first day of testimony, the plaintiff testified that one male colleague was 'relentless' in his pursuit of her and cut her out of email chains and meetings when she ended the affair. Pao is seeking damages from her former employer after claiming she was passed over for a promotion because she is a woman and then fired in 2012 after she complained. Kleiner Perkins has denied wrongdoing and says Pao did not get along with her colleagues and performed poorly after she became a junior partner around 2010. In her testimony, Pao said she was given a poetry book by a senior partner in 2007 that featured drawings of naked women and poems on topics such as the longings of an older man for younger women. The partner also invited her to dinner one weekend while noting his wife would be out of town, she said. 'I thought it was strange, and it made me uncomfortable,' she said. Pao acknowledged having the affair with a male colleague, but said she broke it off when she learned he had lied that his wife had left him. She said the colleague later retaliated by shutting her out of emails and meetings. 'He was relentless and eventually told me that his wife had left him,' Pao told jurors, explaining why she got into the relationship with him. The 45-year-old told jurors how she was excluded from an all-male dinner at Vice President Al Gore's apartment . When she raised the retaliation issue with management, a senior partner explained how he had met his wife at another company while he was married, and perhaps Pao could have the same outcome with her colleague, she testified. She said she repeatedly complained that the colleague was retaliating against her, but 'Kleiner Perkins continued to do nothing.' Pao, who became interim CEO at Reddit after top executive Yishan Wong resigned, said it was humiliating not to be invited to an all-male dinner at Vice President Al Gore's apartment and have to explain to executives she ran into that she wouldn't be attending. Pao lived in the same building as Gore. John Doerr (left) previously took the stand during the trial and discussed whether the firm discriminated against Pao, his former chief of staff . At one point, she said, she felt 'very uncomfortable' about a conversation men were having about pornography aboard a private plane. The men were not Kleiner employees, but had been invited by a senior Kleiner manager, who Pao's attorneys say was present but did nothing to stop the conversation. Kleiner Perkins' attorneys have tried to portray Pao as a chronic complainer who demanded credit for work done by a team, clashed with her colleagues, and twisted facts and circumstances. Her attorneys tried Monday to dispute that portrayal and establish their client's credibility and likeability with the jury. During her testimony, Pao said she had a disagreement with a female colleague, but they improved their communication after spending more time together outside the office, as Kleiner Perkins management had suggested. Steve Hirschfeld, an investigator hired by the firm to look into Pao's bias complaint, testified Monday that she told him that her relationship with the male colleague was not consensual - a contention Hirschfeld did not find truthful. The civil trial is taking place in California Superior Court in San Francisco county. Pao became interim CEO at Reddit after top executive Yishan Wong resigned.\n",

        "input": "(CNN)Cristiano Ronaldo reached 30 La Liga goals for the season but could not prevent Villarreal from grabbing a share of the points in the Bernabeu Sunday in an entertaining 1-1 draw. Ronaldo put Real ahead with a second half penalty after being pulled down and had 13 shots of goal in a lively display, but his team was unable to secure a fourth consecutive win. Gerard Moreno's thumping low strike 26 minutes from time spoiled the home party and Real has seen its lead at the top cut to two points after Barcelona's win Saturday. The arch rivals meet in El Clasico on March 22, with the title very much up for grabs. Villarreal, coached by Marcelino, even fielded an understrength side as it bids to progress in the Copa del Rey and the Europa League, but should have been ahead early when Iker Casillas made a fine save from Moreno and then Dani Carvajal spectacularly headed Moi Gomez's follow-up effort off the line. Real was turning up the heat and Gareth Bale went close for the European champions with a header, while Raphael Varane went even closer with a header that also just missed the target. Ronaldo was a constant threat and after the break he was pulled down inside the area by Eric Bailly and converted from the spot. Bale and Ronaldo should have doubled the scoreline, but Real was made to pay for its wasted chances when Moreno stunned the home crowd with the leveler. Champion Atletico Madrid missed the chance to close to within five points of Real at the top after being held to a 0-0 draw at Sevilla earlier Sunday. Valencia moved to within a point of Atletico after beaing David Moyes's Real Sociedad 2-0 with a double from Pablo Piatti. Wolfsburg wins thriller . In the Bundesliga, VfL Wolfsburg kept up its dogged pursuit of Bayern Munich with a 5-3 win at Werder Bremen in a thrilling eight-goal encounter. Wolfsburg striker Bas Dost scored a double to make it 14 goals in his last nine appearances but his side still trails Bayern by eight points despite its impressive recent form. The match had been under threat due to a security alert in the north Germany city of Bremen, but it was downgraded with extra police on duty at the 42,000-capacity Weserstadion stadium. Earlier police had made two temporary arrests and searched an Islamic cultural center. Monaco holds PSG . In Ligue 1, Monaco, so impressive in beating Arsenal in midweek Champions League action, held Paris Saint-Germain to a goalless draw. PSG was hoping to leapfrog Lyon at the top, but could not break down the stubborn Monaco defense, keeping its 10th clean sheet in the last 11 matches. Lyon, beaten 2-1 at Lille Saturday, still leads title holder PSG by a point at the top.\n",

        "input": "Microsoft has confirmed that it is dropping the Internet Explorer brand. The move was rumoured in December but now the Redmond-based tech giant has said it will use a new name for its forthcoming browser, which is currently code named Project Spartan. It is believed the new browser will look more like Google's Chrome browser and be faster than Internet Explorer. Scroll down for video . Farewell familiar friend: Microsoft\u00a0has confirmed that it is dropping the Internet Explorer brand (logo pictured) and instead will use a new name for its forthcoming browser, which is currently code named Project Spartan . Microsoft's marketing chief Chris Capossela said the company is working on a new name for the browser, which should be in Windows 10. \u2018We\u2019ll continue to have Internet Explorer, but we\u2019ll also have a new browser which is code named Project Spartan. We have to name the thing,\u2019 he said at Microsoft Convergence. The new browser will be the main way for Microsoft 10 users to access the internet, although Internet Explorer will continue to exist, The Verge reported. The re-branding move is unsurprising as Microsoft has tried and largely failed to shake off the bad reputation of Internet Explorer 6, which was notoriously insecure and has regularly made \u2018worst tech products of all time\u2019 lists. The browser, which does not yet have a name, is likely to be rolled out with Windows 10. The new operating system marks the return of the Start Menu, which has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface, combined with the tile set-up that Microsoft introduced in Windows 8 (pictured) The company is thought to be testing names using market research, but so far no final name has been announced. Internet Explorer, which was first called Windows Internet Explorer, was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 in 1995. Internet Explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers, attaining a peak of about 95 per cent during 2002 and 2003. However, it struggled in the face of competition, and in May 2012 it was announced that Google's Chrome\u00a0overtook Internet Explorer as the most used browser worldwide. The brand has struggled to shake off the bad reputation of Internet Explorer 6, which was notoriously insecure. Capossela mentioned that putting \u2018Microsoft\u2019 in front of the secret name boosted the browser\u2019s appeal to some Chrome users in the UK, suggesting the company\u2019s name could appear in the final brand. Mary Jo Foley of\u00a0ZDNet first shared the rumour of a new browser in December. 'Microsoft is building a new browser, codenamed Spartan, which is not IE 12 - at least according to a couple of sources of mine,' she wrote. Thomas Nigro, a Microsoft Student Partner lead and developer of the modern version of VLC - a media playing app - claimed on Twitter in December that he heard Microsoft was building a brand-new browser. 'However, if my sources are right, Spartan is not IE 12. 'Instead, Spartan is a new, light-weight browser Microsoft is building.' It is believed Windows 10 will ship with both Spartan and IE 11 to ensure compatibility with all web sites. Microsoft has not publicly set a firm timetable for the release of Windows. Internet Explorer, which was first called Windows Internet Explorer, was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 in 1995, but since then it has gained a lacklustre reputation. A stock image showing the software package in 1998 is pictured . New operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'. Various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. Users can create multiple desktops to keep things organised. Last year, it was derided for 'missing one' when it announced \u00a0it has decided to jump straight to version 10 of its Windows software in a bid to convince consumers the software is different from current versions. The firm announced the latest version of its Windows operating system, called Windows 10, at an event in San Francisco. It admitted the software was 'at a threshold' after the poorly received Windows 8. Terry Myerson, Microsoft's Windows chief said: 'There's about one and a half billion people using Windows today. 'Devices outnumber people. 'Windows is at a threshold and now it's time for a new Windows. 'Our new Windows must be built from the ground up for a mobile first, cloud first world. 'It wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9.' Microsoft said its new operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever' and will see various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Last year, Terry Myerson, Microsoft's Windows chief, explained how Windows 10 will work on everything from a desktop computer to a smartphone - and even the firm's XBox One games console . The new software will also allow users on hybrid devices like the Surface Pro tablet to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes (pictured) The new Start Menu has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface, combined with the tile set-up that Microsoft introduced in Windows 8. Mr Belfiore demonstrated how the new tiles in the new menu can be personalised and re-sized. This will cover all of the company's smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. Myerson said Windows 10 will be 'a whole new generation' and, as expected, works across a variety of devices - from phones to gaming consoles. It also sees the return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8 to many users' annoyance. In addition to offering a list of a user's favourite applications, the menu brings up re-sizable tiles - similar to those featured in Windows 8's touch-centric interface - on PCs and tablets. The current version, Windows 8, has been widely derided for forcing radical behavioral changes. Microsoft is restoring some of the more traditional ways of doing things and promises that Windows 10 will be familiar for users regardless of which version of Windows they are now using. 'Windows 10 will deliver the right experience, at the right time. 'Windows 10 will be our most comprehensive platform, ever,' said Mr Myerson. 'We're delivering one application platform. One store, one way for applications to be discovered, purchased, and updated across all of these devices.' The firm announced the latest version of its Windows operating system, called Windows 10, at an event in San Francisco in December. It will run on tablets, phones , desktop computers and even the firm's Xbox games console - and come with a yet-to-be-named browser . Industry experts have been having their say on Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 10, which was announced at an event in California in December 2014. Many see the upgrade as being the first steps towards righting the unpopular changes made in the company's previous desktop software, Windows 8, and that is reflected in industry reaction. Stuart Miles, founder of technology website Pocket Lint said: 'The initial reaction is that Microsoft had introduced some really good features that will appeal to many and fix many of the annoyances of Windows 8. 'It looks like they are doing everything they can to make amends for the mistakes of Windows 8, but with a long lead time and many unanswered questions like release and price, there is still much left to learn. 'That said it looks to be a good move from the Redmond based company and one that will benefit many.' Geoff Blaber of technology analysts CCS Insights also noted the need for Microsoft to regain support after Windows 8. 'Windows 10 is the product of a difficult Windows 8 launch and a process of refinement based on vocal user feedback. Microsoft will hope that this marks a fresh start that will convince developers, enterprise and consumers of its One Windows strategy', he said. 'With Windows 10 Microsoft has re-evaluated its approach to software releases by adopting a web mentality that dovetails with the Cloud first, mobile first vision under Satya Nadella. This open, collaborative approach is critical if Microsoft is to overcome the wave of negative sentiment that has plagued Windows 8 since launch. 'The unveiling of Windows 10 is notable for its emphasis on enterprise. This dialling up of corporate versus consumer functionality is much needed not least because enterprise replacements are driving PC market growth. 'Developers are the lifeblood of any platform so it is critical that Microsoft's 'One Windows' mantra delvers on the promise and re-energises developer engagement.' Windows 10 is designed to bring together all of Microsoft's different hardware, such as a the surface tablet (left) and the Xbox One (right) under the same software . Across desktop PCs as a whole, only 13.4 per cent currently run Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, according to research firm NetMarketshare. By contrast, it says 51.2 per cent are powered by Windows 7 and 23.9 per cent by Windows XP, a version that is no longer supported by Microsoft. The start menu in Windows 10 will appear similar to what's found in Windows 7, but tiles opening to the side will resemble what's found in Windows 8. Joe Belfiore, a Microsoft executive who oversees Windows design and evolution, said Windows 10 will offer 'the familiarity of Windows 7 with some of the benefits that exist in Windows 8' to help business users make the transition. Belfiore said that the company was going 'back to basics' with Windows 10, and confirmed that the famous Start menu, which was removed from Windows 8, would be returning. 'We're looking to find the balance, so that all the Windows 7 users get a familiar experience on the devices they already have,' he said. 'It gives the familiarity of Windows 7 with some of the elements of Windows 8.' He said that going from Windows 8 to Windows 10 is like going from a Prius to a Tesla. 'They don't have to learn any new way to drive.' Mr Belfiore also confirmed that Windows 10 would be compatible with both traditional and touch-based device users like tablets through a new task view with buttons scaled up so that they're more friendly to those on touchscreen devices. Users on hybrid devices like the Surface Pro tablet will be able to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes, with Microsoft demonstrating how the interface will change as you do. Although the new software won't be formally released until later this year, analysts have already said that its success is crucial for Microsoft and new CEO Satya Nadella.\n",

Richard Williams faces jail after admitting avoiding paying more than \u00a31million in taxman . His replica German U-boat was moored at Clarence Dock in Leeds, when it was raided by Customs officers . Now, the self-confessed maritime history enthusiast - who has toured the waterways of Northern Ireland and northern Britain in his boat - is facing prison after admitting to avoiding more than \u00a31million in taxes. An investigation by HM Revenue and Customs dating back to 2012 found Williams and his former partner Laurel Howarth had set up a number of companies in Lancashire.

Her amazing image of Porthleven being battered in last year's ferocious storms has won the weather category in the British Life Photography Awards. Scroll down for video . Carla Regler snapped this shot of Porthleven being battered in last year's ferocious storms , and has won the weather category in the British Life Photography Awards . A beautiful photograph of Porthleven take at Christmas last year, somewhat more serene than the powerful storm shots . Last year she won bronze in the Epson International Pano Awards for a different picture of the same scene, both taken on February 5th, the day that the harbour defences were breached. The Cornwall cafe owner said of her latest award 'This photo was taken at sunrise - the sun is trying to come through and that's what gives it that mood. 'It was a quite an emotional day for Porthleven. It was the day the boats were damaged. 'With everything that happened, it's nice to have been able to capture that moment. 'It's fantastic to get this award and I am really pleased.' The British Life Photography Awards recognises the country's 'obsession' with the weather. On the category section, it states: 'Blessed with four seasons, British weather moulds our landscape, coast, the environment and communities.' And the photos the judges are after are 'Images from parched landscapes to flooded meadows, windswept moors to spring sunlight.' Many households on the coast were left without power after ferocious storms swept in from the Atlantic . Unsurprisingly, all trains lines were suspended in Cornwall at the height of the storm, with structural engineers working overtime . In January and February 2014 hundreds of homes were flooded as the worst storms in 20 years continued to cause misery across the country. Waves as high as 30 feet battered the coastline at Porthleven as Storm Hercules reared its ugly head after moving across the Atlantic over the early part of last year. There were thousands of 999 calls in Cornwall alone, and the Environment Agency issued as many as 340 storm warnings across the country, warning of serious risk to life.' Carla and Chris, 39, moved to Cornwall from Wiltshire four years ago and took on a former wool shop in Porthleven, converting it into the seaside cafe of their dreams. But while Chris is the chef, Carla has become so successful at photography that they have turned the upstairs into a gallery to show off her work. Six months ago she was approached to do pictures for a lifestyle company, and she now also runs photography courses, which is amazing considering she has never had any lessons herself and is completely self-taught. Waves reached as high as 30 feet on the Porthleven coastline as Storm Hercules battered Britain in the early part of 2014 . She has two Canon digital SLR cameras, one costing \u00a31,000, the other \u00a34,000 which she used for the award-winning images. 'I tend to stick to landscape and seascape pictures, and I also like taking photos of horses' she said. 'Obviously the scenery along this coast is beautiful and dramatic so you can get some great pictures, in all types of lights and colours depending on the weather. 'The storms were something else - the town took a proper pounding and they are only just finishing repairs to the harbour wall.

        "input": "For one final time, the greatest ever jump jockey will grace his sport\u2019s most spectacular and exciting stage. I urge you not to miss him. McCoy. AP. Nineteen-time champion jump jockey and the most recognisable initials in sport. The 2015 Cheltenham Festival boasts a glittering cast of equine and human stars but the spotlight is on one man. Ruby Walsh (right) will ride Willie Mullins-trained Faugheen in the Champions Hurdle at Cheltenham . The one who will finally walk away from the sport by the end of this season after announcing his abdication following an unchallenged 20-year reign. He is the phenomenon whose record-smashing, off-the-scale achievements have transcended the parochial boundaries of horse racing, the patron saint to millions of punters and sworn enemy of bookmakers. But both sides of that age-old skirmish will probably be praying that the 40-year-old from County Antrim has a final Festival to remember. The next four days for McCoy are not the last time he will ride. It will probably not even be the last time he rides at Cheltenham. McCoy celebrates winning the Gold Cup with Synchronised in 2012 . But it seems like the equivalent of Roger Federer\u2019s last game on Wimbledon\u2019s Centre Court, Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan playing his final frame at The Crucible and \u2014 should Liverpool make it through \u2014 Steven Gerrard stepping on to the Wembley turf in an FA Cup final. But none of those icons can boast the domination of their own sport like McCoy has ruled racing. He is arguably the best pound-for-pound sportsman around \u2014 something crucial in a sport where weights and measures equate to short-head victories or defeats. And nobody loves winning and hates losing more than AP. Thirty Festival wins started with Kibreet in the 1996 Grand Annual Chase. Look back a further 12 months and no-one would have guessed the shape of the last 20 years. His first meeting, then held over three days, consisted of seven rides, three of them 100-1 shots. First up was Supreme Master, who was 16th of 20 in the Supreme Novices\u2019 Hurdle. Champion jockey AP McCoy will be competing his his last Cheltenham Festival before retirement . There was a seventh place finish on veteran Beech Road behind Master Oats in the Gold Cup and his best was sixth place on Brave Tornado in the Triumph Hurdle. The middle Wednesday he was riding at Nottingham \u2014 a track that does not have a jumps course any more \u2014 where he rode a winner. That first experience of the Festival probably taught the young McCoy that Cheltenham is great when you are successful but miserable when it goes wrong. Losing can tear you apart. It is a feeling I know well and McCoy probably enjoyed that Nottingham winner far more than merely being able to play a bit part at the Festival. Just taking part has never been enough for him. There have been times when his pain has been plain for all to see. He got plenty of stick for not smiling even when he won, never mind when he lost. There have been agonising defeats and seasons when his lack of big race Festival ammunition has been tough to take. The fatal injuries to Gloria Victis in the 2000 Gold Cup and Valiramix in the 2002 Champion Hurdle deeply affected him. Jump jockey McCoy has always been a fans' favourite at Cheltenham . As he has got older, he has become better equipped to cope with the Festival roller-coaster of emotions. There will be plenty who point to the tally of 41 Festival wins for Ruby Walsh \u2014 a total fuelled by his alliance with Irish powerhouse trainer Willie Mullins and his former tie-up with British champion trainer Paul Nicholls \u2014 and ask what the McCoy fuss is all about? Who is the better jockey? Who has the best technique? These are subjective assessments which will never be finally settled. I cannot tell you McCoy has some peerless faultless technique others can only dream of. But I can write of the single-minded drive the like of which I have never known. The bloody-minded determination that can make the impossible possible, just as he did when lifting home Wichita Lineman to win on the opening day in 2009. There is the massive physical strength and resilience to inevitable injury. And I can tell you of the unparalleled professionalism he brings to every ride, an unmatched ability to get off a horse and accurately assess its ability and future career direction as well as his encyclopaedic knowledge of rivals\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. Over the next four days, the chances are Walsh will ride more winners than McCoy, who is 10-1 to be top jockey at the meeting. But AP will view those odds as a challenge. He has sound claims in today\u2019s Champion Hurdle on title holder Jezki, a clutch of handicap possibilities and a strong chance with Hargam in Friday\u2019s Triumph Hurdle. Later that day, Carlingford Lough will be his mount to win a third Gold Cup.

        "input": "The last thing Sophie Guidolin expected to discover when she was busy raising two young boys, and advocating a healthy lifestyle to hundreds of thousands was that she was pregnant again - with twins. Six years ago and 28 kilograms heavier than she is now, Sophie saw how her pregnancy with her first two children had affected her body. The 25-year-old from the Gold Coast then decided to turn her life around with an incredible fitness and diet regime that transformed her into the best shape of her life - and a national bodybuilding champion. But despite the shock of having twins, Ms Guidolin is determined to maintain her super-fit lifestyle with the same regime she honed using household items such as chairs, stairs and filled water bottles. Sophie Guidolin is 12 and a half weeks pregnant with twins and aims to stay fit and healthy throughout her pregnancy . 'Twins were a huge shock,' Sophie told Daily Mail Australia. 'We had been trying for a while and there are twins in the extended family, but we never even considered it was an option for us.' But even though she is nearly 13 weeks pregnant, 25-year-old Sophie is dedicated to keeping the weight off in an effort to have a more positive pregnancy than she had in the past. By previously cutting out processed foods, starting a strict fitness regime and going on to win nationals in body building, Sophie plans to keep her body in tact this time. 'My eating habits are not changing at all, I don't eat processed foods, soft cheeses or drink alcohol anyway so I haven't needed to cut anything out which is great,' she said. 'I'm going to listen to my own body.' According to the National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynacologists (NASOG) a diet during pregnancy should be high in fibre and protein while maintaining two litres of healthy liquid a day. Sophie was informed by her obstetrician that she can keep up any form of exercise as long as she consumes water and keeps her heart rate under 160 beats per minute. Sophia Guidolin, 25, lost almost 30 kilograms after the birth of her two young sons, while working full-time and bring up the boys on her own . Sophie and her husband Nathan, who is also a champion body builder, are aiming to help those who struggle to find information on pregnancy that does not generalise . Sophie does not consumer any processed foods, soft cheeses or drink alcohol . 'We had been trying for a while and there are twins in the extended family, but we never even considered it was an option for us' 'I can run, jump and do whatever,' she said. 'They told me not to exercise before they assessed me but they soon realised that I am very fit so it's completely fine.' Sophie is closely documenting her workouts, healthy recipes and lifestyle changes through her social media channels and with 300,000 Facebook likers, her advice is reaching a lot of people. Sophie and her husband Nathan, who is also a champion body builder, are aiming to help those who struggle to find information on pregnancy that does not generalise. She is showing others how she is adapting her training through her Youtube channel which shows her favourite exercises to do during her second trimester. She plans to keep her fitness and diet unchanged through pregnancy . 11 and a half weeks pregnant with twins, Sophie flaunts her flat stomach . The 25-year-old from the Gold Coast retained much of the baby weight from her first two sons . After started some serious cardio exercise and joining a gym, Sophie was approached by a body builder coach and became a national champion . After her pregnancy with her sons, Sophie retained 28 kilograms and vows that will not happen again . Sophie (right before her transformation) is now 28 kilograms lighter and works as a fitness model (right), plus has written two books . The mother of two has turned her life around since becoming active and shedding the baby weight . Sophie vows to listen to her own body through this pregnancy and remain healthy and active . Sophie has two books and over 300,000 Facebook likes and advocates for a healthy lifestyle . Sophie was informed by her obstetrician that she can keep up any form of exercise as long as she consumes water . 'Women become scared of miscarrying if they exercise but this is a complete myth with no evidence to back it up,' she said . 'I want to avoid having a caesarean as they are common with twins,' she said . After having mostly negative experiences with the pregnancy of her first two children, Sophie is aiming for a tranquil natural delivery with her twins. 'I want to avoid having a caesarean as they are common with twins,' she said. Sophie's advice to other mothers who are seeking to keep up a strict fitness regime while pregnant is to not be afraid and ignore the myths. 'Women become scared of miscarrying if they exercise but this is a complete myth with no evidence to back it up,' she said. 'It actually does the opposite and assists in the delivery of birth.'\n",

Mr Justice Hayden today made the two 15-year-olds and three 16-year-olds wards of court - a move which prevents them from leaving the jurisdiction of England and Wales. He made the ruling at a hearing at the High Court after Tower Hamlets local authority raised concerns. The five girls were made wards of court, which prevents them from leaving the UK. Mr Justice Hayden made the ruling today at the High Court (pictured) after hearing the girls had 'shown an interest' in travelling to Syria . The judge, who directed that the girls could not be identified although it is believed all five are from Tower Hamlets in East London, also made orders removing their passports and those of a number of adults involved in their care. He said the ban was a \u00a0'draconian' step, as was the removal of the passport. Mr Justice Hayden told the hearing: 'But the risk contemplated here is as grave as it can be for it is common knowledge that so many have lost their lives in Syria and so many have gone knowing that would be likely. 'As I said early this week in another case, and I repeat it in this, sometimes the law has to intervene to protect these young people, ultimately from themselves. The judge said the ban was a 'draconian' step, but necessary to protect the girls. Pictured: Aleppo, Syria . 'Therefore I am satisfied there is evidence of sufficient cogency and the evaluation of risk is such as to justify the orders sought.' The girls and adults concerned, who were not in court today, can challenge the emergency ruling at a future date if they wish. The judge added he made the order to include the adults because of evidence that in at least one other case young girls had travelled on passports belonging to members of their family. He also said there was evidence suggesting that the family members in the case had not been full and frank with social services, and that the girls had been moving to a more radicalised position. 'It seems to me that that must have been known to the parents and they deliberately did not share it with the authorities who were keen to protect these vulnerable young girls.' Authorities are making increasingly strenuous efforts to stop young British people - including teenagers as young as 15 - trying to reach areas of Syria controlled by Islamic State militants. The ruling comes just three days after the judge banned a 16-year-old boy from Brighton from travelling abroad after his two elder brothers were killed fighting jihad in Syria. The teenager, who cannot be named, was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London on Tuesday. The judge made the ruling after social services at Brighton and Hove City Council raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers' footsteps and travel to the war-torn region. Barrister Martin Downs, representing the council, told the court that three of his brothers had gone to fight for the al-Nusra Front - a group with links to al-Qaeda. British teenagers Shamima Begun, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana walk through security at Gatwick airport before boarding a flight to Turkey in February . Two had died in their teens and the third had been wounded but was still fighting in Syria. A friend of the teenager had also been killed in fighting. Mr Downs added that his family had an 'extraordinary history' and he also had an uncle who had been held in United States' detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The ruling prevents the teenager, who has dual Libyan and British citizenship, from leaving England and Wales. In February Sharmeena Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, all fled to Syria. All four schoolgirls attended Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets. Sharmeena is now living in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, in Syria, as a jihadi bride and told her father she will never come home.\n",

They may be your pride and joy \u2013 but telling your child they are special gives them an inflated view of themselves. And parents who \u2018overvalue\u2019 their children risk creating arrogant, narcissistic adults, according to scientists. A psychological study found that instead of telling children they are better than others, parents should tell them they are as good as anyone else. The research, which tracked participants for 18 months, suggests there is a fine line between self-esteem and narcissism. Children who are repeatedly told they are special go on to have an inflated view of themselves, whereas those who are simply told they are loved tend to be confident and well-rounded. The difference is a child who thinks they are as good as others \u2013 and one who thinks they are better than others and entitled to special treatment. However, narcissistic children still have lower self-esteem than their more modest playmates. The study of 565 Dutch children aged seven to 11 was carried out in a joint project by the University of Amsterdam and Ohio State University. Interviewed four times, parents were asked about their relationship and conversations with their child, and the child was asked how they viewed themselves and others. Lead researcher Dr Eddie Brummelman, from the University of Amsterdam, said: \u2018Rather than raising self-esteem, overvaluing practices may inadvertently raise levels of narcissism.\u2019 Professor Brad Bushman of Ohio State University added: \u2018Children believe it when their parents tell them that they are more special than others. That may not be good for them or for society. People with high self-esteem think they\u2019re as good as others, whereas narcissists think they\u2019re better than others.\u2019 The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that children who were repeatedly told they were special tended to think less of others \u2013 but did not necessarily have higher self-esteem. In contrast, children whose parents showed them more emotional warmth had higher levels of self-esteem. Professor Bushman said: \u2018Overvaluation predicted narcissism, not self-esteem, whereas warmth predicted self-esteem, not narcissism.\u2019 The research, which tracked participants for 18 months, suggests there is a fine line between self-esteem and narcissism . The psychologist, a father of three, said his research had changed his own parenting style. \u2018When I first started doing this research in the 1990s, I used to think my children should be treated like they were extra-special,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m careful not to do that now. \u2018It is important to express warmth to your children because that may promote self-esteem, but overvaluing them may promote higher narcissism.\u2019 Dr Brummelman suggested that parents could be taught to express affection without telling their children they are superior to others. \u2018Future studies should test whether this can work,\u2019 he said.\n",

        "input": "(CNN)As a November dawn breaks over an Irish bar in downtown New York, the early risers inside are hunkered down to watch Lewis Hamilton begin his chase for a second Formula One world title. It's mid-morning in Brazil and Melissa, her husband Alex and their four-year-old daughter are also glued to the TV to watch their hero in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. On the verdant Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, three thousand miles from the desert showdown, another Hamilton fan anxiously waits for the Mercedes man to race to his fate. These supporters, and others around the world from Estonia to South Africa, had voiced their hopes in video messages and their supplications on social media. When Hamilton flicked down his visor, revved the Mercedes' engine and hit the throttle, a global surge of support roared. \"We came out at 6am on Sunday morning to watch the race in a bar in Manhattan,\" New Yorker, and self confessed No.1 Hamilton fan, Christopher Thomas told CNN. \"We met up with fans from all over; we had a guy from the UK and one guy even took a bus from Boston just to watch the race. \"We also made videos and sent them to Lewis' website using the hashtag TeamLH.\" In Brazil, self-styled Melissa \"Hamilton,\" who is married to Alex \"Senna,\" also used the hashtag to communicate with her idol. She told CNN: \"I support Lewis every day but during the races I am aware of everything, even practice and all the interviews. \"At all times he knows he can count on our support, in good times or bad. I am extremely proud to be a fan of his.\" When Hamilton won in Abu Dhabi -- in easier circumstances than expected thanks to an engine problem for rival Nico Rosberg -- and sealed the 2014 championship he was quick to thank his fans in the post-race media conference. \"I always say we win and lose together,\" he smiled. \"The love and energy that I get from my fans... It really made me believe that I can do anything.\" Racing in a global championship has helped Hamilton gain fame across international borders. In 2015, the F1 series will visit an air-mile clocking 20 countries. But when the 30-year-old Briton lines up for Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix, he will do so as the most famous face on the grid. \"Lewis has over three million Facebook fans -- with a third of those coming from the UK -- and he has 2.6 million Twitter followers,\" explained Jon Stainer, managing director of leading sports and entertainment market research company Repucom. \"He has a very strong following. Compared to other F1 drivers, Lewis is also right up there in most of the sport's key markets in terms of celebrity awareness. \"In the big markets -- Brazil, China, India and the UK -- he scores in the top three. Fernando Alonso is the only other [ever-present] driver.\" Tom Roope, whose company Rumpus Room runs Hamilton's digital media, decided to tap into the racing star's global appeal in the build-up to the sizzling Abu Dhabi finale. \"We saw that Lewis' fans were talking to one another and so we came up with the protocol #TeamLH,\" explains Roope. Rumpus Room then devised a real time app, which enabled them to record and upload video messages of support. These twin projects enabled Roope and his team to have a better understanding of the geography and demographic of Hamilton's followers. \"His fanbase is enormously international,\" he said. \"Around 50% of them are from the UK but then there are a lot in Asia, Brazil and the U.S. 30,000 fans uploaded videos from 50 countries. \"There was also a surprisingly high female following, which is probably connected to [his former girlfriend popstar] Nicole Scherzinger.\" The video messages was then edited into four films, which were broadcast daily on Hamilton's social platforms over the race weekend. The final film on race day had a million views on Facebook in one day alone. Our story. Here it is. #TeamLHmovie. Thank you all so much #TeamLH @mercedesamgf1 . https://t.co/HbuiT4jRrw . Hamilton himself explained the concept, and the emotional response it generated within him, after the race. \"This weekend the guy who does my website put together a collage of different clips of messages from people,\" he said. \"I really didn't know what to expect. When I got it there was something happening in my heart. I can't really explain it.\" Thomas and his fianc\u00e9e Julliana Sanchez, as well as Melissa and her family and the Reunion Island fan, were featured in the films. \"It was important to us personally,\" Thomas said. \"It's a big deal for us making a video and seeing him acknowledge his fans.\" Thomas, who is originally from Guyana in South America, has also been galvanizing global support for Hamilton through social media for the last five years. He explained: \"The idea percolated at the Canadian Grand Prix in 2010. My brother-in-law Shaka had a huge painted banner -- it looked like something a five-year-old did -- but at the bottom it said '#LewisNation -- We Believe.' \"We started using it and Twitter was soon blown up with #LewisNation. The initial idea was to unite crew members in North America but when I go on Twitter and Facebook I see people from India, the Philippines, the UK and Germany. \"It's a global base and we are trying to make it bigger. Right now, we use #LewisNation to meet up at races but we've started work on a website.\" Hamilton's mass appeal is not just because he's an F1 driver and now a double world champion. He has something the other 17 drivers simply don't have -- a narrative to rival a bestselling novel, a blockbuster script. Born in Stevenage, a commuter town 30 miles north of London, he broke boundaries when he debuted in 2007 as F1's first black driver. He revealed on his website when his career began he \"tried to ignore that fact\" but has now \"really started to appreciate the implications.\" Hamilton's mixed heritage -- his mother is white British and his father's family have roots in the Caribbean -- and a rags-to-riches success story have both helped him connect with a wider fanbase. \"There's a crossover that appeals to many, many backgrounds,\" said Thomas. \"He's diverse, but not just [in] race but in his social likings too. \"He hangs out with top celebrities like Jay-Z and Kanye West. This hip-hop style and the fact that he spends a lot of time in the U.S. make him one of the few drivers who actually appeals to Americans.\" Roope agreed: \"Lewis is a bit different. He invites a whole new set of people into F1, people who might be put off by the rich, white, middle-classness of it all.\" Hamilton has also always worn his heart on his sleeve against a backdrop of fierce racing rivalry -- usually with his teammates --- and an on-off romance with Scherzinger. There have been some mesmerizing moments on track, and some famous meltdowns off it. Perhaps most remembered was his outburst at the 2011 Monaco Grand Prix. Hamilton had been penalized by race stewards after finishing sixth and exclaimed to the media: \"It's an absolute frickin' joke. Maybe it's because I'm black. That's what Ali G says.\" Many of Hamilton's fans -- though not all -- warm to these moments of human frailty as much as his derring-do on the racetrack, and draw inspiration from both. Melissa races go karts in Brazil and, although she credits her husband Alex for his practical support, she also takes heart from Hamilton. \"Lewis is a fighter, he faced many prejudices and difficult days but he never gave up on his dream; he teaches us that,\" Melissa explained. \"In addition to his talent as a wonderful driver, he has a big heart, a great willpower. \"Many friends are astonished to see me kart racing because I dispute championships with many men, and women on the track are in the minority. \"I win often but women suffer some kind of prejudice. I do not really care, I care to always do my best and be inspired by the best drivers.\" Melissa has met Hamilton at many Brazilian Grands Prix. \"All my meetings with Lewis are fantastic and happy. He is a charismatic and kind person. He really loves his fans.\" Thomas, like Melissa, has met Hamilton \"tonnes of times\" in and around grand prix weekends. \"He seems like a down to earth guy,\" Thomas revealed. \"He's not one of those guys who signs an autograph and shoves it back to you. He actually talks and spends time with you.\" Thomas and his fianc\u00e9e Sanchez are so impressed with the British racer that they graced him with a special honor. \"The first person we invited verbally to our wedding was Lewis,\" Thomas explained. \"We met him in the pit lane at the U.S. Grand Prix last year, he hung out with us, took selfies and we alluded to the fact that we were getting married and said 'hey you're the first invite.' \"We are trying to set a date around the summer break. We can't set the date on a race weekend!\" Being a global personality offers the ability to change people's lives even in a small way but for Hamilton, the relationship he has with his fans appears to be mutualistic. \"Lewis is genuinely indebted to his fans,\" said Roope. \"He always sees his fans as the core of his powerbase.\" When he drives out of the garage in Australia, the world champion may be racing to end the season as No.1 but he also carries the hearts and hopes of millions.

McNeil Consumer Healthcare, of Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, acknowledged failing to take corrective action after discovering the adulterated bottles of Infants' and Children's Tylenol and Children's Motrin. The company agreed to pay $25 million to resolve the case. Metal particles, including nickel, iron and chromium, were introduced during the manufacturing process at McNeil's plant in Fort Washington. Prosecutors said McNeil knew about the problem for nearly a year but failed to take immediate steps to fix it. Admission: McNeil Consumer Healthcare acknowledged failing to take corrective action after discovering adulterated bottles of Infants' and Children's Tylenol and Children's Motrin which contained metal particles . The company and prosecutors said in court Tuesday that no one was injured. 'McNeil's failure to comply with current good manufacturing practices is seriously troubling,' Acting Assistant Attorney General Mizer said in a statement after the judge accepted McNeil's plea. 'The Department of Justice will continue to be aggressive in pursuing and punishing companies such as McNeil that disregard a process designed to assure quality medicines, especially OTC drugs for infants and children,' he said. McNeil is a unit of Johnson & Johnson. The New Brunswick, New Jersey, health care giant has struggled with scores of product recalls since 2009. In this case, McNeil first learned of the particle problem in May 2009, when a consumer complained about black specks inside a bottle of Infants' Tylenol, according to court documents. McNeil subsequently found metal particles during production but continued making the liquid medicines for several more months. Products: Metal particles, including nickel, iron and chromium, were introduced during the manufacturing process at McNeil's plant in Fort Washington . 'There were investigative steps taken, but not all of the steps required under all of our internal operating procedures,' company attorney Michael Schwartz told The Associated Press on Tuesday. McNeill eventually traced the problem to the machinery at its plant in Fort Washington and issued a recall. The Food and Drug Administration said the potential for serious medical problems was remote but advised consumers to stop using the medicine. The suburban Philadelphia plant \u2014 which was linked to several recalls of Tylenol and other nonprescription drugs for children and adults \u2014 was shuttered in April 2010 and rebuilt from the ground up, but it has yet to reopen. The company is operating under an agreement with the FDA requiring increased inspections and oversight at its factories. McNeil said Tuesday it has significantly improved its procedures. 'McNeil has been implementing enhanced quality and oversight standards across its entire business to ensure we are best able to meet our commitment to consumers, patients and doctors who rely on our products,' company spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said.\n",

With the game looking as though it was heading for a 1-1 draw, Welsh manager Carl Robinson put faith in his veteran compatriot, bringing him on as an 87th minute substitute for the Vancouver outfit . Within three minutes, the former Premier League striker was putting the ball in the back of the net and showboating his trademark somersault celebration. Vancouver striker Robert Earnshaw (right) chips the ball over the onrushing Portland Timbers goalkeeper . The former Wales international leaps over Adam Kwarasey as they both watch the ball sail into the net . Earnshaw punches the air in delight as he celebrates his 90th minute strike that decided the game . Following a finely weighted through ball from Pedro Morales and some circus-like defending from former West Bromdefender Liam Ridgewell and Nat Borchers, Earnshaw found himself bearing down on goal with just the keeper to beat. Putting any debut match jitters to one side in front of the home crowd at BC Place, the 33-year-old finished with aplomb with a delightful dink over the onrushing Adam Kwarasey. Giles Barnes (Houston Dynamo) Andrew Driver (DC United) Dom Dwyer (Kansas City) Lewis Neal (DC United) Nigel Reo-Coker (Vancouver Whitecaps) Liam Ridgewell (Portland Timbers) Darel Russell (Toronto FC) Matt Watson (Vancouver Whitecaps) Lloyd Sam (New York Red Bulls) Bradley Wright-Phillips (New York Red Bulls) Steven Caldwell (Toronto FC) Callum Mallace (Montreal Impact) Adam Moffat (FC Dallas) Andy Dorman (New England Revolution) Steven Gerrard (LA Galaxy)* . Frank Lampard (New York City FC)* . *Set to join . After his signing was confirmed on Wednesday, the former Cardiff, Nottingham Forest and Derby County striker's input took the 'Caps to their third straight victory before they host LA Galaxy on Sunday, and he was thrilled to get on the score sheet so early in his Whitecaps career. 'The length of time I've been playing football and that feeling when the ball hits the net, oh my god, it's the best,' Earnshaw told reporters after the game. But it's not the first time Earnshaw has been among the goals during an MLS debut. The Welshman also netted on his first game for previous club, Chicago Fire, and also bagged a brace on his home debut with Toronto FC. Caps boss Robinson is a keen admirer of Earnshaw and his match-winning performance on Saturday merely confirmed his belief. 'I said he'll get one chance,' Robinson said. 'I brought him here because he can score goals. When he gets the chance and he gets in the right position, he usually takes it. I knew he'd get one chance. The coolness of the finish and the calmness in his head was outstanding.' Former Wales striker Earnshaw, who announced his retirement from international football last week, is not the only Brit to be plying his trade in the ever-expanding MLS. Earnshaw is not the only Brit to move to the MLS and will be joined by New York FC's Frank Lampard (left) Since David Beckham's high-profile move to LA Galaxy in 2007, and with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard and former Chelsea star Frank Lampard set to embark on a career in America, there has been an influx of British talent travelling across the Atlantic. Among those stars currently earning a living in the States alongside Earnshaw and Ridgewell are former Charlton forwards, Bradley Wright Phillips and Lloyd Sam\u00a0(New York Red Bulls), former Burnley and Wigan defender Steven Caldwell (Toronto FC) and ex-Aston Villa midfielder Nigel Reo-Coker (Vancouver Whitecaps).\n",

        "input": "(CNN)Nigerians are scheduled to head to the polls this Saturday in what will be the most closely watched elections in Africa this year. The poll will test the strength of an electoral process that has been marred by violence and flawed results throughout the country's short democratic history. The stakes are high, and there is a very real danger of prolonged violence across the country if the electorate questions the legitimacy of the outcome. The conduct of the elections will have long lasting repercussions on both Nigerians and the U.S.-Nigeria relationship. Against the backdrop of these elections is the ongoing threat and destabilization caused by Boko Haram, a group that has killed more than 10,000 people in northeastern Nigeria during its five-year campaign of terror, and kidnapped hundreds more, including young girls. These actions have shocked and horrified Americans. What many Americans may not recognize is how important the relationship with Nigeria is for the United States. We have economic and security interests that are at stake in this election, especially as Nigeria has been one of our strongest allies in the region since military rule there ended. In the last decade, the U.S. has trained and equipped thousands of Nigerian soldiers who have participated in peacekeeping missions in Mali, Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia, helping bring a measure of peace and stability to nations in the West Africa region. But now we need Nigeria to be a front-line ally against terrorism, particularly as Boko Haram pledges fidelity to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Meanwhile, Nigeria also has the largest economy in Africa and has the continent's largest population. Indeed, it has been identified as one in the next set of prominent emerging economies, making it a tantalizing target for U.S. private investment. It is also Africa's No. 1 oil producer, although an increasingly diversified economy -- for example in the agriculture sector -- provides a myriad of opportunities for more robust trade with the United States. Ultimately, a stable Nigeria will mean real economic opportunities for Americans -- a win-win proposition. Yet despite this potential, the uncertain electoral environment and other serious challenges stand in the way of a deeper bond. The reality is that endemic corruption remains an obstacle to more cooperation, especially when you consider the Nigerian military's poor performance fighting Boko Haram, despite security spending reportedly being around $6 billion last year -- clearly, much of the money meant for the military is not being spent on salaries, equipment or materiel. Similarly, weak governance remains an impediment to Nigeria's progress and enhanced ties with the United States. Nearly 70% of those in areas in the north live in absolute poverty, according to recent data, as compared to about 50% in southern areas of the country. Such failure on the part of the government to address poverty and inequality facilitates Boko Haram's recruitment effort and foments internal instability. The Nigerian people clearly believe that these issues must be addressed. According to an Afrobarometer survey released in January, 74% of Nigerian citizens said that their country is going \"in the wrong direction.\" Half of Nigerians surveyed expressed significant concern about political intimidation or violence in the current election environment. If the Nigerian leadership rises to the challenge of tackling these difficult issues, there is nothing standing in the way of even closer ties between our two countries. But it is not just about the leadership -- this election offers the chance for all Nigerians to choose their future, and decide which policies will shape the next four years. Their example, for better or worse, will be watched -- and perhaps even replicated by other African states. The decisions made in the coming days and weeks will shape U.S.-Nigeria relations for years to come. But more importantly, they will determine the future for Nigeria's people. The world is watching Nigeria's historic choice with great expectation and even greater hope.\n",
        "output": "Robert Menendez: Nigerian vote will test the democracy's electoral process, marred by violence and flawed results in past . U.S. ties to this regional ally are crucial; U.S. economic and security interests at stake as Nigeria's voters choose their future .\n"

He said his two daughters ran away in fear after being targeted by an 80-strong fancy dress \u2018mob\u2019 who described themselves as \u2018migrants, HIV activists, gay people, disabled people and breastfeeding mums\u2019. The bizarre protest featured several women and men clutching dolls to their chests in an apparent reference to the Ukip leader\u2019s comments that nursing mothers should \u2018sit in the corner\u2019. Scroll down for videos . Nigel Farage has branded anti-Ukip protesters 'scum' after they stormed a pub where he was having a family lunch and 'chased his car down the road' The party leader was dining with his wife and two younger children at the Queen's Head in Downe, Kent, when the incident took place.\u00a0He claimed his two youngest children were so scared by the protesters that they ran away and hid . Mr Farage said his daughters, Victoria, 15, and ten-year-old Isabelle were missing for a short time yesterday afternoon before the police returned them to the family home. After hounding him out of the Queen\u2019s Head in Downe, Kent, protesters surrounded his car, kicking it and jumping on his bonnet as his wife, Kirsten, tried to drive him away. The Ukip leader later told the Mail: \u2018We were having a pleasant Sunday and then suddenly the mob descended. There was various screaming, shouting and intimidation. \u2018My children ran away and hid. The landlord called the police who came quickly and later brought them back to my home. They also attacked my car as my wife drove me off.\u2019 He added: \u2018I\u2019m used to this \u2013 it happens every day. But I am utterly appalled by these disgusting people for bringing my family into it. It was an unpleasant ordeal for them.These people are scum.\u2019 The protest\u2019s organisers denied Mr Farage\u2019s children were scared and ran away. Pictures posted on Twitter as Mrs Farage tried to drive off showed a woman lying on the car bonnet as others banged the roof and windows. Neighbour Sheila Jenkins, 76, said she heard \u2018chanting\u2019 outside her house and looked out of the window to see demonstrators in fancy dress. Demonstrators had previously descended on the George & Dragon, where Mr Farage has previously been pictured having a drink, before realising he was in the other pub nearby . The group was in fancy dress and included migrants, HIV activists, gay people, disabled people and breastfeeding mothers . She said: \u2018There were lots of them and I saw a big placard saying \u201cUkip not in my backyard\u201d. There was a man dressed as an Arab, with big dark glasses and a turban, and one with a big beard in a blonde lady\u2019s wig. I don\u2019t know what they were trying to prove.\u2019 Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said he stepped out to see what the commotion was. \u2018They were singing \u201cWe are family\u201d and then I saw someone trying to stop a car getting through,\u2019 he said. \u2018Someone kicked the back of the car as it went past. I think they went a bit too far.\u2019 Photos taken in the pub showed demonstrators apparently holding a \u2018Muslim call to prayer\u2019 and organising \u2018Polish language lessons\u2019. Protester Chris Baugh, assistant general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, boasted on Twitter: \u2018I just chased Farage from his local, few others with us & very funny. Solidarity.\u2019 Customer James Beer, owner of a web design company, tweeted: \u2018Just saw Nigel Farage being hounded out of a pub I was in by fancy dressed protesters harassing him and kicking his car in. Priceless.\u2019 Staff at the Queen's Head refused to comment on the episode, while the George & Dragon said protesters had initially claimed they were there for a birthday party . The party leader was dining with his wife and two younger children at the Queen's Head in Downe, Kent, when the incident took place. He is pictured at the pub last June . But many were shocked, even those who oppose Ukip. Kevin Maguire, a left-wing columnist, tweeted: \u2018No fan of Ukip and also no fan of hounding people out of pubs, frightening kids and jumping on cars.\u2019 Dan Glass, another of the protest leaders, denied Mr Farage\u2019s children had been scared off, saying: \u2018He was sitting on his own and left on his own. We didn\u2019t see any kids.\u2019 The organisers later released a statement attributed to \u2018photographer\u2019 Mike Kear. It said: \u2018As some protesters and the press entered the rear of the pub, I saw a blonde haired woman leaving with two children. At no time were any children seen to be scared or running away. Could this be that Farage is manipulating the truth for his own ends?\u2019 Ukip is understood to have requested taxpayer-funded security for Mr Farage during the election campaign amid fears that he is regularly being targeted by protesters.\n",

Television pundits Graeme Souness and Jamie Carragher - both former Liverpool players - led the criticism of Chelsea for surrounding referee Bjorn Kuipers during Wednesday's Champions League exit against Paris St Germain. Former Liverpool captain Gerrard told BBC Sport: 'I think it's normal when you play games at that level. Players want to win so much. The Chelsea players surround referee\u00a0Bjorn Kuipers at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday against PSG . 'You've got managers who want to win so much, players will try every trick in the book to get over the line and try and win football matches. 'Sometimes it doesn't look nice, but we've all been guilty of it throughout our careers, of not always abiding by the rules. Football's not always going to look nice.' The French side progressed to the quarter-finals on away goals despite having Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off and Gerrard added: 'PSG were the better team and good luck to them.' Gerrard hopes to sign off his Anfield career by helping Liverpool to FA Cup glory and a place in the top four.

John Terry (centre) led the protests following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge on Wednesday evening . The Sky Sports pundits were scathing of Chelsea's 'pathetic' behaviour at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday . The 34-year-old midfielder, who leaves for Los Angeles Galaxy in the summer, has recovered from a hamstring injury after sitting out the last seven matches and is available for Monday's trip to Swansea. With the Reds facing a cup quarter-final replay at Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn next month, the possibility of Gerrard leading the side out for a Wembley final on his birthday is still alive. He said: 'I've just got over a hamstring injury and I am fit and available for the next game. 'I want to finish the season really strong and leave the team in the top four and hopefully go all the way in the FA Cup - that is how I want to sign off.' Gerrard and Carragher stand by their teams for the match organised by the Liverpool FC Foundation .

'He may get some stick on the day but for me it shows you what type of guy he is for coming and helping out.' Gerrard, whose side will be managed by current Reds boss Brendan Rodgers, had first pick of the players and managed to get Suarez, Torres, Alonso, Terry and Thierry Henry into his side. Carragher, who will line up alongside the likes of Drogba and ex-Reds goalkeeper Pepe Reina, said: 'Stevie has gone for the Galactico-type team; if you look at his front five they're not going to get back to help much and the age of Stevie and Alonso they need a bit of help in there.

Carl Griffiths, 22, was forced to sit on the bench for his club side after wearing out his last pair and he could not find replacement footwear. But now, the 6ft 8in forward can return to the fold after being fitted with a pair of custom-made, orange Adidas boots. Carl Griffiths proudly holds up his size 21 Adidas boots, presented to him by Wales captain Sam Warburton . The 6ft 8in forward had been unable to play for almost half a year, but is now able to play again . Mr Griffiths gleefully laces up his new orange boots at the home of his local club, Trimsaran RFC . Mr Griffiths, who lives in Carmarthenshire, West Wales,\u00a0had been playing in size 18 boots for the past three years with his toes curled up in the ends. But after keeping them together with black sticky tape, they eventually fell apart. With his height, his club Trimsaran RFC miss him on the pitch, particularly in the line-outs. Desperate to play, Mr Griffiths contacted every major sports company he could think of asking if they had 21 size boots - 11 sizes bigger than the average man - but had no joy. But finally, after almost half a year stuck on the sidelines, they can welcome him back to the side thanks to the hand-delivered parcel from Warburton, who holds the record for the most Wales caps as captain. Mr Griffiths was cheering his team on from the touchline when the Welsh no 7 arrived with the parcel. He then laced them up before running out for his first game in months. He said: 'It is amazing to be able to play the game I love again - and be able to wiggle my toes in my boots! 'I can't thank Sam and the guys at Adidas enough for making these boots especially for me. 'I had no idea they were planning this and I had almost given up hope of ever finding boots that would fit me again.' Mr Griffiths towers over Warburton, the Welsh rugby captain, in his new Adidas orange size 21 boots . The 6ft 8in forward was delighted to meet Warburton, who presented him with the boots at Trimsaran RFC . Warburton said: 'As soon as the team at Adidas told me about this story I bit their hand off to be involved. 'I\u2019ve had my fair share of injuries and breaks from the game over the years and I know it\u2019s one of the worst feelings you can have. 'It\u2019s great to have been involved in getting Carl back on the rugby field and you can tell it means a lot to him and his team mates. 'I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be reminding him that he has some big boots to fill now though.' He had been playing in size 18 boots with his toes curled up, but eventually his feet came through the boots . The 22-year-old has size 21 feet -\u00a011 sizes bigger than the average man, but can now play rugby again . It is believed Mr Griffiths' enormous feet are the result of drugs he was given to combat childhood leukaemia. He was eight years old when doctors discovered he was suffering from the disease, and after a course of chemotherapy he was treated with steroids to help him regain his strength. His feet sprouted within a year of stopping steroid treatment at 13 after he was given the all-clear, which is unusual because steroids usually restrict growth.\n",

And Steven Gerrard looks just about ready to live in the lap of luxury when he relocates to the West coast of the States this summer with his family. One sprawling Malibu mansion the footballer has reportedly viewed with wife Alex and children has been unveiled, an outstanding property overlooking the ocean which used to belong to\u00a0The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster. Scroll down for video . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard and his family are set to move into this sprawling mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean when he relocates to Los Angeles to play for LA Galaxy in June . Gerrard (left) with his daughters and wife Alex are looking forward to their big move later this year . The Liverpool captain is set to end his 17-year career with the club at the end of the season . The 34-year-old (right) will be leaving his boyhood side for LA Galaxy on an 18-month deal in early June . The family will reside in Los Angeles for 18 months while he plays out his contract with the team, and although it's a long way from his home in Merseyside, there's no doubt the family will feel incredibly comfortable in the not-so-humble abode. Reportedly worth $25m - \u00a316.8m - the luxurious pad is said to have been offered to the midfielder, 34, by his new football club, who'll foot the $20,000 a week (\u00a313,400) rent over the 18-month period he's signed to the team. Steven, along with his model wife Alex, 32, and their daughters Lilly-Ella, ten, eight-year-old Lexie and Lourdes, three, are already said to be building themselves a \u00a33million five-bedroom house on a two-acre site in an upscale area in Merseyside. But that doesn't much compare to their potential American property, which they could be set to move into in early June after the sportsman's long and illustrious career with Liverpool comes to an end in late May. With six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, the swanky property also boasts sweeping mountain and Pacific Ocean views and was regularly featured on reality show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Yolanda Foster and her music producer husband David had the modern property custom-built to their taste in 2009, and resided there with the 51-year-old star's three children, including model Gigi Hadid. The property, reportedly worth \u00a316.8m, includes six bedrooms, nine bathrooms and plenty of living space . Gerrard's new home is just a short 15 minutes from beach-perfect Santa Monica . Gerrard will be able to enjoy a spot of billiards in his games area - which comes complete with a bar . Located in the resplendent area of Carbon Canyon in Malibu, near to Los Angeles International Airport and just a short 15 minutes from beach-perfect Santa Monica, it seems the Gerrard family will have lots to keep them occupied over the next year and a half. The large house also includes separate exercise, massage and sauna areas inside, and also a magnificent infinity pool outside. There's a sizable barbecue area too, and a garage big enough for three cars, housed in its own private orchards of citrus and avocado trees. The stylish home also includes a screening room for those big-movie moments, and a 'sports room', with a full-sized billiards table and bar, for when Steven wants to forget about football after work and let his proverbial hair down. The house is perfect for entertaining, and US reality star Yolanda had a professional chef\u2019s kitchen build with a custom floor-to-ceiling glass refrigerator. One of the bedrooms in particular opens up into a stunning panorama of the ocean . Gerrard (left) will be hoping to end his Liverpool career on a high by winning the FA Cup this season . Gerrard follows in David Beckham's footsteps who played for LA Galaxy between 2007-2012 . In the official pictures of the impressive property, it is clear it's finished to an incredibly high standard, a combination of both contemporary and classic design, with a deluxe Californian and certainly Hollywood-style vibe. It's going to be a huge adjustment process for both Steven and his family, but he's not the first British footballer to make such a move: David Beckham famously left Madrid to play with LA Galaxy back in 2007, and he moved his entire family out to Los Angeles for the job. The MLS team recently confirmed Steven's signing following his decision to turn down the offer of a contract extension and leave Liverpool after 17 years with his beloved team. 'Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years,' he said on confirming his move. 'I'm not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I'm going over there to win, and if I win and play well, then my life becomes more enjoyable. 'There's obviously a bonus of where the LA Galaxy are located as well. That will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different.' Gerrard scored twice from the penalty spot during Liverpool's Foundation charity match on Sunday . And a senior Galaxy official confirmed: 'The club is helping Steven and Alex with every imaginable aspect of their family move and we are obviously hoping to get them settled as soon as possible.' Alex returned to Liverpool last month after jetting to Los Angeles in search of a new home for her, her husband and their adorable girls. Tweeting shortly before she returned, she wrote: 'Last day in LA coming home tonight !! VIlla Blanca for lunch then last few bits of shopping, looking forward to seeing my man and girls.' And it seems like the move can't come quick enough for the Gerrard family. Alex, who has been married to the footballer since 2007, recently tweeted her disdain for the typical British rain, something she surely won't miss when moving to sunny California in June. 'Wish this rain would do one !!!' she wrote on Twitter while watching her man play in the All-Star Charity match at Liverpool's Anfield on Sunday. MailOnline has contacted a representative for Steven Gerrard and is awaiting comment.

Neither he nor attorney Daryl Parks would say exactly when the suit would be filed, but they said that they disagreed with the grand jury's and the Justice Department's decisions not to charge Wilson in the shooting. \"They have accepted (Wilson's) self-defense,\" Parks told reporters. \"We do not accept his self-defense.\" The slain teen's parents, Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden, were in attendance at the news conference but did not speak on advice of their attorneys, Parks said. \"The last 24 hours have been tough for them,\" he said. Word of the lawsuit comes a day after the Justice Department determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge Wilson in Brown's death but found in a separate investigation that the Ferguson Police Department showed a pattern of racial bias. Brown Sr. and McSpadden released a statement Wednesday saying they were disappointed that Wilson would not face charges, but, they added, the federal report on the police department could provide a silver lining. \"We are encouraged that the DOJ will hold the Ferguson Police Department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color,\" the statement said. \"It is our hope that through this action, true change will come not only in Ferguson, but around the country. If that change happens, our son's death will not have been in vain.\" In November, a grand jury cleared Wilson and, in an uncharacteristic move in grand jury proceedings, the prosecutor released all the evidence that was considered. Gray said the civil lawsuit will rely on \"pretty much the same evidence,\" but it will be cast differently. The jury in the civil lawsuit will be asked to make a determination based on a lower burden of proof -- by a preponderance of evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, Parks said. Summing up the crux of the Brown family's case, Parks said, \"There were other alternatives available to (Wilson). He did not have to kill Michael Brown.\"\n",

Jarvis Cocker is here, and so are Bob Geldof and Rupert Everett. There are the requisite grey ladies in fur and chapeaux, as well as twenty-somethings in backpacks huddled in groups, downing their drinks before walking into Pace London's booze-free exhibition space for the opening of A Strong, Sweet Smell of Incense: A Portrait of Robert Fraser. While his name may ring few bells outside of the seasoned London art community, eminent gallerist Robert Fraser, who ran a gallery in London during the Sixties and again in the Eighties, was a seminal part of the Swinging Sixties scene. His notoriety hinged on scandal, parties and friendships with the most famous rock stars of the era, as well as an undeniable talent for spotting art's Next Big Thing. This is the eminent dealer who sold art to Paul McCartney, and hosted John Lennon and Yoko Ono's first joint exhibition; the Savile Row-clad Etonian whose Mayfair galleries attracted the likes of Marlon Brando, Marianne Faithfull and William Burroughs in the 60s and 80s; the silver-tongued heroin addict who introduced Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat to Britain, and was arrested -- and, in his case, imprisoned -- for drug possession with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards during the 1967 Redlands Bust. Curated by the artist Brian Clarke, A Strong, Sweet Smell of Incense -- a winking reference to the police report describing the bust -- aims to blend the rebel, the art connoisseur and the hedonist to present a rounded image of an unsung star of the 60s. \"There are oceans of anecdotes by Robert, and some of them are true. But the anecdote isn't enough to convey the kind of energy that he had, this kind of magnetic energy that drew you to him -- or repelled you depending on your own energy,\" says Clarke, arguably the world's most well known stained glass artist. I first met Clarke three weeks before the opening at his spacious cottage-cum-mansion in London's tony Notting Hill neighborhood. A literal portrait of Fraser painted by Basquiat hangs prominently in the living room, surrounded by works by Warhol, Francis Bacon and others. Clarke, who was a close friend of Fraser's and was the first artist exhibited at his 80s gallery, is still finalizing the exhibition selection, but his energy is easy, if a little manic. Harriet Vyner, a long-time friend of Clarke and Fraser, and author of the Fraser biography Groovy Bob: The Life and Times of Robert Fraser, has been collaborating with him on the catalog. She's on hand to add her own anecdotes to the ocean. \"I remember going to Seditionaries, (Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's 70s punk shop) on the King's Road, and it felt a bit scary, but that was part of the thrill,\" she says. \"And that's what people often felt about going to the Robert Fraser gallery in both incarnations.\" The idea for the portrait came from Pace London's managing director Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst a year ago, when Clarke told her he'd been entrusted with Fraser's archive. (Fraser died of AIDS-related illness in 1986 at the age of 49.) \"The 'light bulb moment' really struck when we realized that Pace founder, Arne Glimcher, was setting up his first gallery in Boston at the time Fraser was opening his own gallery in London,\" Dent-Brocklehurst writes in an email. \"We're exploring our own DNA with this exhibition while paying tribute to one of the most flamboyant dealers and aesthetes. \"There's a buzz in London right now around the exhibition and many artists, museum directors, celebrities, aspiring artists, art students are all very keen to rediscover Robert's personality.\" To hear Clarke speak about Fraser is to have assumptions alternately challenged, rebuked and confirmed. He makes no excuses and offers no explanations for Fraser's \"more hedonistic side,\" but emphasizes his generally quiet demeanor and modesty. The overall impression is of someone with an acute eye for talent (he showed Bacon, Warhol, Dennis Hopper, Richard Hamilton, Jim Dine, Robert Mapplethorpe and Jean Dubuffet) and a rebellious, destructive streak. This is reflected in the exhibition itself, which is set up like an archive. Works from the luminaries Fraser knew, showed or admired are on the walls, while personal effects -- a thank-you note from Ed Ruscha, a Sex Pistols Never Mind the Bollocks poster, arrest warrants, an opium pipe with the gold rim worn to silver -- are kept behind glass cases. In one corner, there's a recreation of his desk. Take a few steps, and you're looking at the drum from The Beatles' 1967 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover, which Fraser art directed. Other elements reflect their personal relationship. A Gerhard Richter that recalls a joint trip to Berlin to see his works in person. An inscribed copy of an Edward Burne-Jones biography was gifted from Fraser to Clarke. There was more to Fraser, it seems, than the people he associated with. \"There is always around Robert this aura of all these celebrities and things like that, and it's true that they were there, but it wasn't anything that he either curried or boasted about,\" Clarke says. \"He was not a respecter of persons. He liked people or he hated them.\" He was often reluctant to discuss his connections and friendships, even with those close to him. Clarke remembers discussing Truman Capote with Fraser at length during a stay in New York. He didn't realize the two were friends until Capote came over to their table a few nights later to hug Fraser. Similarly, Vyner remembers Fraser fawning over Prick up Your Ears, John Lahr's 1978 biography of playwright Joe Orton, without once mentioning that he was an early backer of Orton's productions. (She would discover this while researching Groovy Bob.) \"For all of the inevitable references to the hedonistic side of Robert, he had a very sophisticated intelligence in terms of visual art, and genuinely in terms of culture,\" Clarke says. \"So whilst he was not inclined to talk culture, he was eminently capable of it.\" Back to Pace. A party-goer and I get to chatting about the exhibition, the party, and Fraser. She enjoyed the party, but didn't -- doesn't -- know much about Fraser the man. \"The exhibition is so chaotic and eclectic,\" she says. \"Maybe that was him as a person?\" Around 9:00 pm, security guards are shepherding the reluctant crowd out of the building, into the cold night. On the steps, a particularly drunk kid tries and fails to goad someone into a fight, while the less inclined start hailing cabs and mapping how to move the night into Soho. I recall something Clarke told me a few weeks prior, an effort to summarize the spirit of Fraser's galleries and its infamous parties, studded with stars and doused in glamor and excitement. \"When you were with Robert, you felt there was nowhere really much better to be. You knew that you would not have more fun anywhere else, that's for sure, and you would not be more stimulated,\" he'd said with a kind of wistfulness. \"It was brief and short-lived, but that light burned bright.\" A Strong, Sweet Smell of Incense: A Portrait of Robert Fraser is on at Pace Gallery London, Burlington Gardens until March 28, 2015.\n",

Sturridge reported for duty at St George's Park on Monday but did not train and had a scan in the evening which revealed a thigh problem which he sustained against Manchester United on Sunday. The 25-year-old striker returned home on Monday night, the second Liverpool player to withdraw from international duty on the day, Adam Lallana was also forced out with a groin injury and was replaced by uncapped Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason. Daniel Sturridge has been ruled out of England's double header with Lithuania and Italy . The Liverpool striker picked up a hip injury in Sunday's defeat by Manchester United . Goalkeepers . Jack Butland, Robert Green, Joe Hart . Defenders . Danny Rose, Chris Smalling, Kyle Walker, Nathaniel Clyne, Phil Jones, Kieran Gibbs, Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka, Gary Cahill. Midfielders . Michael Carrick, Theo Walcott, Ross Barkley, Fabian Delph, Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Raheem Sterling, Ryan Mason, Andros Townsend . Forwards . Danny Welbeck, Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane . They will miss a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday and a friendly against Italy in Turin on Tuesday. A FA statement said: 'Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has left the England squad and returned home to his club on Monday evening. 'This follows a scan on an injury that he sustained during Liverpool's game against Manchester United on Sunday. 'The England medical team took the decision on Monday evening having assessed Daniel following the squad's arrival at St. George's Park on Monday afternoon.' For Sturridge it is the latest in a sequence of fitness issues this season. He was Hodgson's first-choice centre-forward at the World Cup last summer but missed five months of this season after pulling a thigh muscle during an England training session in September. There was a blaze of controversy about whether he should have been resting or training on that particular day, followed by complications in his recovery process, none of which helped the relationship between club and country. Sturridge then suffered with calf muscle injuries and was just getting back to his sharpest form when he hobbled out of Anfield with a stiff hip after scoring Liverpool's goal in a 2-1 defeat against Manchester United. He will have missed seven England games since his last international appearance against Norway in September. Sturridge has not played for England since the autumn because of injury . Harry Kane could be in line to make his debut for England against Lithuania . August 2012 - Toe injury . February 2013- Thigh injury . September 2013 - Thigh injury . September 2014 - Thigh injury . October 2014 - Thigh injury . Sturridge and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, however, will be wary of taking risks after a campaign already ruined by injuries and with the Anfield club locked in a fight for a top-four finish. Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck are available for Hodgson but Sturridge's exit boost Kane's chances of making his senior debut against Lithuania on Friday. There may also be the chance of a call-up for QPR's Charlie Austin, or promotion from the Under 21s for Burnley's Danny Ings. Kane, 21, is in the midst of a remarkable season and took his goal tally to 29 with a hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday, but a club-v-country issue is brewing around him because England want him for the European U21 Championships, in June, while Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino thinks he needs a month of complete rest at the end of the season. England are set to train at Tottenham on Thursday and Pochettino plans to be on site. Raheem Sterling arrived at St George's Park nursing a toe injury which may limit his involvement over the two England games \u2013 he is one of the players who may be released after the Lithuania qualifier. Fabian Delph was also missing from the camp on Monday. Aston Villa midfielder Delph was ill and stayed at home but hopes to join the squad later this week. Luke Shaw and Fraser Forster were in Hodgson's original squad but pulled out with injuries, prompting call-ups for Danny Rose and Robert Green. Another important Liverpool player, goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, is doubtful for Belgium after picking an ankle injury in a collision with Rooney on Sunday.\n",

        "input": "MPs will be banned from claiming expenses for dinners, TV licences and taxis before 11pm following the general election. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) confirmed that politicians' perks will be cut from May 8. The move, which is likely to cause anger among MPs who already complain that the system leaves them out of pocket, emerged as the watchdog announced a raft of changes for the next parliament. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has confirmed that certain perks for politicians will be cut from May 8 . Ipsa said: 'We will implement the rule changes agreed in December 2013, including removing hospitality claims and the late sitting food subsidy. We have tightened the rules on taxis and hotels after late sittings of the House. 'We will no longer allow claims, under the accommodation rules, for TV licences and home contents insurance.' Elsewhere, staffing budgets are to go up 1 per cent to \u00a3147,000 for MPs in the London area, and \u00a3140,000 for those from outside the capital. The office costs budget is rising 0.5 per cent to reflect inflation, but accommodation budgets have been frozen. The watchdog had proposed a raft of curbs to expenses in 2013 as part of a wider package that included salaries rising by 10 per cent from \u00a367,000 to \u00a374,000. It suggested that trimming perks and pension benefits would offset the costs of the controversial pay rise. Prime Minister David Cameron has said that a 10 per cent pay rise for MPs is 'unacceptable' at a time when public sector rises are restricted to one per cent . The changes will go ahead even though the pay rise is still subject to review and David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have signalled they may block it. Mr Cameron has said he regards the hike as 'unacceptable' at a time when public sector rises are restricted to one per cent, while Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg have said they do not believe it should go ahead. The move - which is likely to cause anger among MPs who already complain that the system leaves them out of pocket - emerged as Ipsa announced expenses rules for the next parliament. But while the expenses reductions will now come in to force automatically on May 8, the MP salary boost will be subject to a review due to be carried out in the weeks after the poll. The watchdog theoretically has the final decision on the issue - although there have been suggestions that the law could be changed in order to prevent the increase. The cross-party Commons Standards Committee has previously condemned the expenses cuts, arguing that the rules are already 'considerably less generous' than in many companies. Highlighting the plan to drop the \u00a315 currently claimable for dinner when the House sits beyond 7.30pm, the committee said: 'If such expenses are not met by the employer, then the employee is able to claim tax relief on subsistence costs of travel between work places. 'The rules for MPs are already considerably less generous than this. 'We also note that when there is whipped business, members must be within easy reach of the division lobbies. 'Once again, we consider there needs to be a stronger evidence base before it can be asserted that these are costs which other professionals would expect to meet for themselves, unless they had been dealt with through a salary supplement rather than expenses.' The committee said MPs routinely worked 60 or 70 hours a week and the tightening of the expenses system in the wake of the scandal that rocked Westminster already meant some had taken to sleeping in their offices. 'We do not consider that Ipsa has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses,' the report said. The changes will see a halt to claims for tea and biscuits, and hotels only allowed if they are booked after 1am.\n",

Instead, John Lewis, Lego and H\u00e4agen-Dazs are seen as integral parts of the country\u2019s fabric. Dyson and Virgin Atlantic are also new entries in the top 20 most popular big brands \u2013 an annual survey of 2,500 shoppers by market analysts at the Centre for Brand Analysis. Love lost:\u00a0Cadbury, Heinz and Marks & Spencer have now dropped off the list of Britain's top 20 favourite \u2018superbrands\u2019, having been replaced by John Lewis, Lego, Virgin Atlantic and H\u00e4agen-Dazs . Topping the chart for the second year running is British Airways, followed by Rolex, which was founded in London in 1905. Cadbury was last year No 11 but does not even feature this year \u2013 following a string of controversies since it was taken over by American company Kraft in 2010. The most recent public backlash came a few weeks ago when it changed the recipe of Creme Eggs and shrank the size of their multipacks. Heinz \u2013 famed for its baked beans, tomato ketchup and tinned soups \u2013 has also slipped off the list after appearing at No 5 last year. It is not known why the company, which has always been US-owned, is falling out of favour with Britons. What's not to love: Ice cream brand\u00a0H\u00e4agen-Dazs is new on the top-20 superbrands list . But our increasing curiosity in more exotic flavours and dishes could be one reason. However, the demise of M & S, which was No 18 in 2014, will be particularly painful for its bosses, especially as rival John Lewis has leapt into the chart at No 6. Marks & Spencer has endured three difficult years, fuelled by poor sales of its womenswear and teething troubles with its new website. Virgin Atlantic makes its first appearance at No 20 but has some way to go before catching up with winner BA. Just last week, BA\u2019s parent company IAG said it expected profits to surge 20 per cent to around \u00a31.6billion this year. The firm\u2019s share price hit an all-time high as a result. Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive of the Centre for Brands Analysis, said: \u2018British Airways retaining the No 1 spot is a great example of a much-loved traditional brand that has also refreshed, refocused on innovation and invested to remain attractive and relevant. \u2018It is winning out, while newer innovators, such as Google, go in reverse, as the shine comes off.\u2019 The internet giant has slipped from No 7 to 18, while Apple \u2013 the richest company in the world and best-known for its computers and mobile phones \u2013 is at a relatively lowly 10. Both have suffered a backlash over accusations they have failed to pay a fair share of their taxes in the UK.\n",

On one day alone, Saturday January 17, 300 managed to gain entrance to the Channel Tunnel when chaos ensued after a truck caught fire, it emerged at the weekend. Hundreds more have succeeded in stowing away on trucks which board ferries linking Calais to the Kent coast.\u00a0Many more opt for soft touch French Channel ports like Ouistreham and Cherbourg where border controls are less stringent. Waiting: Less than 1000 Africans and Asians are now estimated to be sleeping rough in squats and at three open air camps close to the ferry terminal at Calais . The homeless migrants pay Albanian people-smugglers hundreds of pounds to be ferried south of Calais and loaded into lorries at motorway rest areas . Scores of migrants gained access to the ferry terminal in large numbers this winter when a winter storm blew down security fences and hundreds invaded truck car parks. Less than 1000 Africans and Asians are now estimated to be sleeping rough in squats and at three open air camps including the notorious 'Jungle 2' close to the ferry terminal. At the beginning of the year when a day centre opened on the outskirts of the port and began serving food to refugees, numbers were estimated at around 2,500. Local newspaper Nord Littoral reported at the weekend that 'It is difficult to estimate the number of migrants present in Calais but one thing is certain : it has decreased significantly'. The newspaper quoted a spokesperson for a charity organisation as saying : 'We think there are about one thousand, maybe even fewer.' Hiding: Hundreds of migrants have stowed away on trucks boarding ferries linking Calais to the Kent coast . Camp: The homeless migrants in Calais pay Albanian people-smugglers hundreds of pounds to be ferried south of Calais and loaded into lorries at motorway rest areas . Pessimists at Calais predict that numbers of UK bound refugees will increase again to 300 plus during the spring and summer as new arrivals from Libya fleeing persecution by Islamic extremists start arriving . Numbers increased dramatically last summer as waves of Eritreans and Ethiopians hit the French Channel coast and set their sights on the UK. There were violent scenes as knife- wielding Sudanese nationals clashed with Eritreans over territorial disputes . Nord Littoral points to two main causes for the exodus . One is that 'more men and women are getting through' to the UK. The other is that migrants disheartened by months of living in cold and squalid tents have opted to apply for asylum and have been transferred to state run hostels as far afield as Burgundy, hundreds of miles south of Calais. A spokesman for the French Immigration department said, ' Since September 2014 more than 400 registered as applying for asylum and 45 percent of those have been given protection'. Making a dash: Scores of migrants gained access to the ferry terminal in large numbers this winter when a winter storm blew down security fences and hundreds invaded truck car parks . At the beginning of the year when a day centre opened on the outskirts of Calais, numbers were estimated at around 2,500. There are now said to be fewer than 1,000 people living there . At the beginning of February 60 Africans were ferried southwards from Calais and put up in a former Gendarmerie at the town of Pouilly en Auxois in Burgundy south east of Paris. Pouilly is just one of dozens of villages all over France which have been designated to accommodate asylum seekers whilst their applications are being processed . Residents of the small village have protested to local mayor Bernard Milloir at the influx of Sudanese, Eritreans and Ethiopians. Monsieur Milloir called the complains 'nauseating'. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart welcomed the decrease in migrants numbers at the port attributing the rise in numbers seeking French asylum to the opening of the day centre and installation of CCTV cameras. In January she called on aid groups to evacuate the filthy Jungle 2 squat and move migrants to a municipal camp nearby. Last year Madame Bouchart threatened to open a floodgate of migrants to swamp Britain and called for the UK border to be moved back to Dover to ease congestion at her port. Work is currently in progress at the Jules Ferry day centre to prepare overnight accommodation for women and children only due to be available at the end of the month.\n",

Mike Brown has been suffering from concussion and missed England's defeat in Ireland last week . Brown was knocked out while tackling Italy's Andrea Masi at Twickenham last month . 'We're pretty confident about Mike. He's had a reasonable amount of time now and certainly all the signs from everyone, including from Mike himself, is that he's back to 100 per cent,' head coach Stuart Lancaster said. 'He has to tick the final box and then I'm sure he'll be training on Friday. He has been symptom free since last week.' Alex Goode deputised for Brown on the afternoon England's Grand Slam dream evaporated at the Aviva Stadium and while he produced some fine moments, he was out-jumped during Robbie Henshaw's try in the key moment of the match. Goode will play for Saracens at Wasps on Sunday, after which Lancaster insists he will make a call on who starts at full-back against Scotland when the Red Rose seek to revive their title aspirations. 'Both Mike and Alex will compete for that 15 shirt next week,' Lancaster said. 'Mike has a lot of experience and does bring a lot to the team, but Alex had a good game against Ireland and dealt with the high balls well. 'If you see Johnny Sexton against other teams, he always seems to find grass with his tactical kicking but Alex managed to cover all those eventualities. 'There was a lot of work that came Alex's way and he did well. I'm keeping an open mind until next week.' Brown is set to return to training in a much-needed boost to England boss Stuart Lancaster . Alex Goode will compete with Brown for the No 15 jersey after filling in against Ireland . Inside centre Luther Burrell has a calf injury but Lancaster is 'reasonably optimistic' he will resume training on Tuesday. Lancaster's immediate impression after England had been kicked into submission by Sexton and his Lions half-back partner Conor Murray was one of a 'tight Test decided by small margins'. And having reviewed a defeat that has halted the momentum generated after Wales and Italy were swept aside in an encouraging start to the Six Nations, Lancaster voices his exasperation at failing to deliver during key moments. Luther Burrell has picked up a calf injury but Lancaster is hopeful that the centre will be fine for Scotland . Lancaster is adamant that Johnny Sexton was the reason between defeat and victory in Ireland . 'There's frustration that we hadn't delivered the level and quality of performance that we'd hoped to,' Lancaster said. 'We knew how difficult it was going to be. It was right up there alongside the Wales game, if not tougher because of the quality of the opposition and the run they were on. 'They're a high-quality team across the board. They have a simple gameplan that they execute well, primarily when Jonny Sexton is on the field. It changed when he came off. 'We needed to be at the very top our game to have got a win over there. We weren't quite and that was the frustration. 'There were moments in the second half when they got the try on the back of an advantage from a penalty. That left us with a big hurdle. 'We came back and there were definitely some key moments around the 70th minute when we had a try disallowed. 'You have to be able to control the big moments and we didn't get enough of those to win the game.'\n",
        "output": "Mike Brown is ready to return to training on Friday . Full-back missed England's Six Nations defeat in Ireland last week . Brown was concussed in early stages of victory over Italy last month . Stuart Lancaster reveals his star full-back is feeling 'back to 100%'\n"

The photo of the Boeing 737-800 was snapped this month at Beijing Capital International Airport and went viral after it was uploaded onto Chinese social media networks. It showed the door\u2019s lock out of position while the plane was in the air at China\u2019s busiest airport, drawing criticism from air safety experts. This photo showing a plane door's lock out of position went viral on Chinese social media networks . Air safety expert Guang Yu told local media: \u2018It is probably not dangerous because there are various safety measures in place but it shows an extremely sloppy and careless attitude on behalf of the cabin crew.\u2019 Chinese state media agency Xinhua quoted an Air China spokesman as saying that the airline conducted a thorough investigation, including interviews with the plane\u2019s crew and other staff, after the photo surfaced online. It said the investigation found that the lock was in the \u2018normal\u2019 position when the flight took off. A Boeing specialist quoted by Chinese state media said that human error or a mechanical problem with the lock could result in an external lock being out of position. Air China said an investigation found that the lock was in the proper position when the flight departed . The expert added that a mechanical problem would not affect flight safety because of another locking system operated from within the cabin. The report also said that it appeared to be a case of mechanical failure. The photo sparked debate on Chinese social media website Weibo, and was shared after several incidents involving Chinese passengers opening plane doors before take-off or after landing. Last week a 42-year-old Chinese man was detained for 10 days after he opened an emergency exit shortly before a Urumqi Airlines plane was due to take off. The man told authorities that he thought the door handle was a handrail that he could grab onto for support, \u2018like the handrail on a bus\u2019. A Urumqi Airlines flight was delayed last week after a passenger opened the emergency exit . He was removed by police and detained for causing a disruption for others on board the plane, which was travelling from Urumqi to Zhengzhou. That incident was at least the fifth time since December a passenger has opened an emergency exit on a plane in China. Last month, an unidentified man was detained for 10 days after opening a plane emergency exit as passengers were boarding at Nanjing airport, the South China Morning Post reported. He told airline staff \u2018The door is not important\u2019 when they asked him why he opened the door, the newspaper reported. In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors on a China Eastern flight in Chengdu . In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors in protest of a weather-related delay as their China Eastern flight taxied to a runway in Chengdu. It led to a longer delay for everyone on board. A month earlier, a man was arrested after he opened the emergency exit \u2018to get off quicker\u2019 after a China Eastern flight landed in Hainan. By unlocking an opening the emergency exit, he deployed the emergency slide. Also in December, a rookie traveller yanked open a door on a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu to \u2018get some fresh air\u2019 shortly before it was supposed to take-off.\n",
        "output": "Air China said it conducted an investigation after the photo surfaced . It said that the lock was in the 'normal' position during take-off .

When asked on whether he had any remorse for the current 64 drug\u00a0traffickers inevitably facing death row, including Chan and Sukumaran, Widodo defended his decision on denying them clemency. 'We want to send a strong message to drug smugglers that Indonesia is firm and serious in tackling the drug problem and one of the consequences is execution,' he said.

Shackled and handcuffed, Andrew Chan cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Kerobokan prison . 'The court has sentenced them and we cannot discriminate between countries.' The Indonesian president justified his hard stance on the issue by stating that there are 4.5 million people in the country affected by drugs and this paints a grim picture for the future generations of Indonesia. However, he would not comment on whether he is a personal supporter of the death penalty. Al Jazeera's Step Vassen asked Widodo if he believes he is portraying a double standard by trying to free Indonesian drug traffickers who are facing the death penalty in other countries. 'No...

'At this stage, it hasn't been able to be arranged,' he told reporters in Sydney. The executions of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were due as early as the weekend but have been delayed until all legal avenues have been exhausted, prompting fresh hope of a 'change of mind' from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. A spokesperson from the office of Muhammad Prasetyo, Indonesia's attorney-general, confirmed on Friday afternoon that the government had placed the executions on hold.

The 200lb week-old newborn was captured collapsing under its own weight as it struggled to walk beside its mother at the Samburu National Park in Kenya. Photographed by Margot Raggett, the images show the elephant mother patiently wandering beside its baby as it repeatedly wobbles and collapses while learning to walk. Scroll down for video . The elephant calf, wandering close to its mother for support decides to raise a leg to its trunk . But in doing so, the overconfident youngster wobbles and attempts to correct his balance . Unable to correct itself, the calf then collapses into a heap on the ground . It then gives up completely, flopping onto its side in the dry riverbank while its mother looks on . She said: 'Young elephants are one of my favourite species to photograph, they are so adorable. 'If they are not playing and being mischievous they are acting like clowns while trying to find their feet. 'This youngster completely lost its footing in the dry riverbed and then when it finally struggled to its feet proceeded to examine one of its feet like it was to blame for it falling over.' She added: 'In the meantime the mother just carried on patiently grazing, though you could see she was keeping a watch on the youngster out of the corner of her eye'. Adult elephants take a great deal of care of calves, helping them climb steep banks and protecting them from predators. If a calf loses its mother for some reason other female in the group will take care of it.

        "input": "Jerusalem (CNN)After a bitter campaign, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is claiming victory as his main rival Isaac Herzog concedes. Many questions linger about exactly what this means for U.S.-Israeli relations and Israel's standing in the Middle East. CNN global affairs correspondent Elise Labott has been covering the Israel election in depth and took to Facebook to answer your questions about the election. Here are five highlights from the chat: . 1) How did the race go from exit polls saying it was a neck-and-neck race to Netanyahu claiming victory within a matter of hours? I know, right? It's a great mystery as to how the exit polls got it so wrong. There's one pollster here in Israel named Avi Degani who predicted that Netanyahu would win all along. He said that the polls here in Israel rely too heavily on modern methodology and aren't really suitable for people outside city centers like Tel Aviv. There's also the question of whether Netanyahu gained more seats because of the 11th-hour push to the right. Part of the explanation is that he cannibalized votes from the other right-wing parties. Also worth noting that Israeli elections always have surprises. In the last election, no one predicted the amazing turnout for Yair Lapid, whose Yesh Atid party won 19 seats. This time, he only won around 11. Why were the election polls so wrong? 2) What does Netanyahu have planned for his next term? That's the $6 million question. The Obama administration was waiting for the election to be over to see who they would be dealing with. They knew even if Prime Minister Netanyahu won re-election, they would need to re-engage with him. I think both sides realize that the U.S.-Israeli relationship is too important to continue as it has been. But I think the tone Prime Minister Netanyahu sets now will dictate how the White House deals with him. Opinion: Will Netanyahu win seal Iran deal? 3) What is Netanyahu's plan regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? In the final days before the election, Prime Minister Netanyahu made a big push to energize his right-wing base. He promised that there would not be a Palestinian state under his watch, backtracking from a commitment he made in 2009 for a two-state solution. Now the right wing that helped keep him in office is going to be looking for him to deliver on his campaign pledge. It's not encouraging. Now that he has a new mandate, perhaps he will feel more confident to explore possibilities with Palestinians. However the unilateral moves Palestinians have taken since the collapse of peace talks last summer doesn't give him much encouragement either. 4) Was Netanyahu's statement about not recognizing a Palestinian state a political move to get votes, or a true ideal he wants to hold up? It's a great question that nobody knows the answer to just yet. Even the Netanyahu camp would admit that they made a conscious effort to reach out to right-wing voters, many of whom do not want to see a Palestinian state. For many years Netanyahu has at least agreed to negotiate with the Palestinians, even if sometimes actions like continued settlement activity call into question his true commitment. It remains to be seen whether Netanyahu considers his re-election as a mandate from the right to govern in this hard-line way or whether he will try to soften these hard-line positions. In the hard-line way is how he appeared in the final days of the campaign. 5) As an American, what impact do the Israeli election results have on me? In other words, why do I need to care? I think Israel is a very important ally of the United States in a region where there is a hell of a lot of turmoil. The U.S. looks to Israel as a stable democracy with whom it shares, for the most part, similar values and interests. Clearly the relationship between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama has soured the ties between the two nations. Whether the two leaders can repair the relationship now that Netanyahu has been re-elected will, in large part, dictate how they work together. As an American, whether the U.S. has a friend in this volatile region does impact our national security. Read the full chat: .\n",

At the time of the crash, the Civil Aeronautics Board ruled the probable cause of the crash was error by the pilot, Roger Peterson, who took off from Mason City to Moorhead, Minnesota, in inclement weather, even though he was qualified. The chartered plane crashed in Iowa not long after takeoff, killing Holly, Peterson, and musicians Ritchie Valens and J.P. Richardson. Now L.J. Coon, an experienced pilot from New England, says a variety of other factors - such as weight and balance calculations, the rate of the plane's climb and descent, fuel gauge readings and the passenger-side rudder - should have been considered, according to The Globe Gazette. Wreck: On February 3, 1959, a light aircraft chartered by Buddy Holly crashed in Clear Lake, Iowa, killing the singer and three others aboard. An investigation into the reasons for the crash - ruled at the time to be pilot - could now be reopened, after a pilot petitioned for other factors to be considered . Fiery: The accident, known as 'The Day the Music Died', that occurred on February 3, 1959, killed rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J. P. 'The Big Bopper' Richardson, as well as the pilot, Roger Peterson . Too young: Buddy Holly was only 22 when he died, with his career only lasting 18 months. He is still considered one of the best musicians of all time . Tragic: The body of one of the three famous rock 'n' roll singers killed in the crash of a single engine bonanza lies a few feet from the wreckage of the plane on February 3, 1959, in Clear Lake, Iowa . The National Transportation Safety Board has agreed to consider reopening the investigation. Coon's motivation was to 'the heroic effort that took place in those 4.9 miles' by the pilot, Peterson, before the plane crashed. The plane had been in the air less than four minutes. Coon received a letter from the NTSB saying they had received his call for a reinvestigation. 'You have gotten our attention. Let us do our due diligence in order to give you a proper answer,' the letter stated. The NTSB will now determine whether or not the submission meets the requirements of a Petition for Reconsideration. History and many other people believe that Peterson was the direct cause of the February 3, 1959 crash. Killed: Buffy Holly, who was one of the most popular entertainers of the 1950's, died in a plane crash in 1959 . In memoriam: A giant pair of glasses marks the place where Buddy Holly died in Clear Lake, Iowa . Gary W. Moore, author of Hey Buddy, a book about Holly's life, told the Globe Gazaette that the Aeronautics Board got it right 56 years ago. 'I think that what (a new investigation) is going to find it is its pretty simple,' Moore said. 'The pilot was unqualified to fly in those conditions and he lost control of the airplane.' Holly, a rockabilly pioneer, was only 22-years-old when he died, with a career lasting 18 months. Despite such a short time, Rolling Stone in 2004 ranked Holly as number 13 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\n",

That's not looking such a gamble now. Nineteen goals later during one of the most breathtaking and honest seasons in recent memory, he's level with Diego Costa. Kane is with Roy Hodgson's England squad this week and can lay claim to being the country's only genuinely complete frontman. STATS Scroll down to see a full breakdown of Harry Kane's 19 goals . Harry Kane - pictured scoring against Leicester City on Saturday - has netted 19 times this season . Kane is training with the England team at St George's Park for the first time this week . Kane's goals have come from a variety of angles in what has been a staggering season for Spurs . Graphics were provided by\u00a0Squawka. His international team-mates who share St George's Park with him in the coming days will doubtless notice the 21-year-old's range of ability. Kane is as comfortable 25 yards from goal as he is in the penalty area \u2013 and the visuals of his stunning campaign tell the whole story. Predominantly right-footed, it's little wonder that 10 of his strikers have come that way, but Mauricio Pochettino \u2013 and now Hodgson \u2013 will be enthused at the other ways in which he finds the net. Kane's spike of goals came around Christmas and he has added more headers and left-footed strikes recently . Kane (celebrating scoring against Aston Villa in November) has been in stunning form for Spurs . Brad Guzan had no chance after Kane's free-kick swerved beyond him at Villa Park . Four have come via his head, with five slammed home with his weaker left peg. Nine goals have been netted from more than 12 yards out. Those include a 29-yard hit in the 5-3 win against Chelsea on New Year's Day, and that stunning swerving free-kick at Aston Villa earlier in November. Compare that to Wayne Rooney, who has 11 for the season - nine of which came with his favoured right. His goals have contributed 22 points to Spurs charge towards the top four, too. Kane's rise to prominence has been staggering and, with five goals in his last three, is in prime position to pip the injured Costa and send the bookies into a sulk.\n",

Beanca Moise and Jo-Anna Thiboutot, both 16, were rushed to the Kings County Hospital Center on March 14 suffering multiple fractures and bruises after being struck by a car as they attempted to cross the street mid-block in a section of Flatbush Avenue, according to the\u00a0New York Post. Moise said she thought the cops standing near her hospital bed, as doctors swarmed around her, were there to see if she was okay. Tickets: New York cops gave Beanca Moise (photographed) and Jo-Anna Thiboutot jaywalking tickets as they were being treated in an emergency room, suffering multiple injuries, after being struck by a vehicle in Brooklyn . Instead, they were there to give her and Thiboutot tickets for jaywalking -- illegally or recklessly crossing the street without regard for approaching traffic. 'It was very insulting,' Moise told the Post. 'I got hit by a car, and they came to the hospital not even checking if I was okay, and just gave us the ticket.' The cops told the Post that they were simply following Mayor Bill de Blasio's Vision Zero orders - an effort to end traffic deaths and injuries by cracking down on reckless drivers and pedestrians. They told the teens' parents that the tickets were mandatory given the mayor's 'zero tolerance' jaywalking policy. Mandatory: The cops told Moise's (photographed) and Thiboutot's parents that the tickets were mandatory given Mayor Bill de Blasio's 'zero tolerance' jaywalking policy . Thiboutot's mother, Rose Benjamin, was handed the teen's summons as her daughter was being treated for deep bruises and gashes on a hospital stretcher. The accident reports and the girls' summonses blame the teens for running into traffic because the girls were attempting to cross the street mid-block, the Post reports. Each summons was signed by one 63rd Precinct cop, a 'PO Nagle.' The driver, Edwin Lawrence, did not receive a summons because a witness reportedly told police Lawrence had the right of way. Jaywalking summonses have risen to 2,000 a year since the mayor implemented the crackdown, according to the Post. The cops told the Post that they were simply following Mayor de Blasio's (center) Vision Zero orders - an effort to end traffic deaths and injuries by cracking down on reckless drivers and pedestrians . 'Crackdown:' Wiley Norvell, a spokesperson for City Hall,\u00a0took to Twitter Saturday saying that five tickets a day in a city of millions is hardly a 'jaywalking crackdown' The girls' families plan to fight the summons and sue the driver. They hired lawyer Michael Goldberg who questioned why the officers had to hand-deliver the tickets to the girls while they were being treated at the hospital, the Post reports. Weeks after the incident, Moise remains on crutches and reportedly needs two more months to recover from fractures and bone contusions. Though the officer's held that they were simply following orders in delivering the 'mandatory' tickets, Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for City Hall, told Gothamist that there is 'no such thing as a 'zero tolerance' policy on jaywalking.' 'Enforcement decisions are made precinct by precinct as commanding officers see fit, based on conditions they see on the ground,' he said. Serious Injuries:\u00a0In 2014, an elderly man, Kang Wong, suffered serious head injures as NYPD cops attempted to arrest him after stopping the man for jaywalking in the city's Upper West Side . Norvell stated that five jaywalking tickets are issued each day adding that 100 are given for failure to yield. Norvell took to Twitter Saturday saying that five tickets a day in a city of millions is hardly a 'jaywalking crackdown.' The city saw an increase in jaywalking tickets shortly after the mayor implemented the Vision Zero plan in 2014. With Police Commissioner Bill Bratton embracing the mayor's plan, the New York Police Department issued more than 400 jaywalking tickets in the first two months of 2014 -- compared with just 50 the year before, the\u00a0Post reports. The jaywalking 'crackdown' provided tickets to many New Yorkers last year, Meanwhile de Blasio and his security detail were caught on video jaywalking.

Rob Baxter's side could not follow up last season's success as they struggled to cope with a powerful Sarries outfit who were able to call upon the services of England internationals Alex Goode, George Kruis and David Strettle as well as Argentina centre Marcelo Bosch. Tries from Strettle (two) and Nick de Jager did the damage with Ben Spencer adding eight points from the boot. Maro Itoje (centre) lifts the LV= Cup title after Saracens beat Exeter 23-30 on Sunday . David Strettle led the way for Saracens with two tries against Exeter at Franklins Gardens . Strettle touches down his second try as for Saracens against Exeter in the final for his team . Exeter replied with a brace of tries from Max Bodilly with Ceri Sweeney kicking two penalties while replacement fly half Gareth Steenson kicked two conversions late on. Bodilly's early error handed Saracens an attacking scrum when the Exeter full back's long kick went dead in goal. The Sarries pack capitalised on their first set-piece and decimated the Chiefs pack allowing Ben Spencer to post the first points of the afternoon. The Chiefs responded immediately with winger Tom James making a scything run through the Sarries defence before he was hauled down inches short of the line. Sireli Naqelevuki, Jerry Sexton and Ben White carried on the attack before Brett Sturgess was held up over the line. Their efforts did not go unrewarded, however, as Sweeney kicked a three-pointer to level up the scores. Sarries were dealt a big blow just before the break when Spencer was sent the sin-bin for failing to roll away at the ruck following a powerful break from powerful Chiefs centre Hughes. Sweeney made no mistake from the tee to give his side a deserved lead heading into the break. Sarries began the second half a man down but it was the Chiefs who found themselves under pressure as Strettle intercepted White's wayward past to sprint over for the opening try of the game. Goode, who had replaced winger Mike Ellery late in the first half, could not add the extras from the touchline. Strettle soon has his second try as the Sarries winger pounced on Spencer's perfectly-weighted kick to touch down in the left corner. Goode failed with the extras once more but it mattered little as Saracens established a 13-6 lead. Saracens were in the ascendancy and, following a superb break from Spencer, flanker De Jager powered over from close range in the 62nd minute to further extend his side's lead.

        "input": "(CNN)Police in Charlottesville, Virginia, will publicly discuss on Monday the results of their investigation into an alleged gang rape of a University of Virginia student, which was initially reported last year in Rolling Stone magazine. The police findings could put to rest a complicated controversy about the alleged gang rape of a female student at a fraternity party. The accusation has been controversial because of the nature of such a crime and because the accusation itself has been clouded by subsequent questions about the Rolling Stone article. After the account was published last fall, Rolling Stone magazine later apologized for discrepancies in its article about the alleged gang rape after friends of the victim expressed doubts about the woman's account and the accused fraternity chapter denied key details. CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter described Rolling Stone's announcement as falling short of a full-scale retraction. It remains unclear what really happened to the female student, Stelter said. \"We are in the phase here where Rolling Stone is trying to figure that out,\" Stelter said in December. \"They've apologized, but not retracted. So they're not saying the story is false. They're just saying there are some questions they need to figure out the answers to still.\" The Charlottesville Police Department will hold its press conference at 2 p.m. ET on Monday. Rolling Stone editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly \"orchestrated the attack on 'Jackie' (the woman who was the subject of the article) nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her,\" a decision the magazine said it regretted. \"In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced,\" Rolling Stone said in December. Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana later tweeted that \"the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story.\" University of Virginia pledges zero-tolerance in rape cases . The article chronicled the school's failure to respond to that alleged assault. It prompted an emergency meeting by the school's governing board and the announcement of a zero-tolerance approach toward sexual assault cases. According to the magazine, Jackie, who at the time had just started her freshman year at the Charlottesville school, claimed she was raped by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, while two more gave encouragement, during a party. However, the University of Virginia's Phi Kappa Psi chapter did not have a party the night of September 28, 2012, the date when the alleged attack occurred, or at all that weekend, the chapter said. The chapter's lawyer, Ben Warthen, told CNN that is proved by email and fraternity records. Warthen said there were other discrepancies in the accuser's account. For example, the accused orchestrator of the alleged rape did not belong to the fraternity, the fraternity house has no side staircase, and there were no pledges at that time of year. Jackie told the magazine she hurried out a side staircase after the incident and said her attackers egged each other on, asking, \"Don't you want to be a brother?\" CNN's Greg Botelho, Melissa Gray and Sara Ganim contributed to this report.\n",

        "input": "Three Watertown police officers have recalled their chaotic gun battle with the Boston bombers four days after the explosions that killed three people and injured 264. Testifying at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial on Monday, the officers also recounted the terrifying moment he raced towards them in his getaway car - but fatally struck his older brother, Tamerlan, as he fled. The brothers fired a gun at three police officers and hurled bombs at them, including one that was similar to the devices used in the April 15, 2013 attack, the officers testified. Watertown Police patrolman John Reynolds recalled chasing the brothers in two cars hours after they allegedly shot and killed a police officer in nearby Cambridge, and having a large bomb thrown at him and a colleague as they tried to arrest the Tsarnaevs. On trial: In this courtroom sketch, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, center, is depicted between defense attorneys while the boat in which he was captured in sits on a trailer for observation during his federal death penalty trial . Getting a close look: The jury visited the bullet-ridden boat where he was found in April 2013 . 'My ears were ringing, I could hear all the car alarms going off for many blocks around us, there was a huge cloud of smoke,' he testified in court in Boston. 'I could feel all the debris landing on me.' The gun battle continued for eight minutes, he said, . 'It felt like there were hundreds of rounds,' he said. 'It was non-stop.' The jury saw a photo taken during the gun battle, showing two people that Watertown Police Sergeant John MacClellan identified as the Tsarnaev brothers, crouching in front of a black Mercedes during the gunfight, which played out on a street tightly packed with houses. James Foley, who lived on the block, testified that he was sleeping in the living room of his home with his three-week-old son when he was awakened by gunshots. 'I looked outside and I could see guns firing,' Foley said. 'I didn't look for long. I saw that it was pretty serious and I wanted to get my kid back upstairs to the back of his house and into his crib.' Reynolds, MacClellan and a third officer, Sergeant Jeff Pugliese, attempted to tackle Tamerlan, who was a trained martial artist. As they struggled to handcuff him, Dzhokhar sped towards them in the black Mercedes that the brothers had carjacked. Reynolds said he heard the engine revving. Found: Investigators work near a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts the day after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding inside in April 2013. On Monday, the jury in his death penalty trial visited the boat . Evidence: A still video image shows the covered boat being transported for viewing by the jurors on Monday . 'Get off! Get off! He's coming back toward us!' he recalled himself shouting. He fired and hit the windshield as Dzhokhar drove towards them but he didn't stop. An officer tried to pull Tamerlan out of the way but couldn't, ABC reported. 'Tamerlan was run over by the Mercedes,' Reynolds said. Sergeant John MacLellan added: 'It was very violent. The car was jumping back and forth with the body stuck up under the wheels.' Tamerlan was not immediately killed by his injuries and Reynolds testified it was still a struggle for him and a second officer to handcuff him after Dzhokhar drove off. He died later that day. Dzhokhar briefly escaped, ditching the car and hiding in a drydocked boat in a backyard. Reynolds also testified about the moment he came across the two men days after the bombings and after they had killed an MIT campus security officer. He was on patrol at 12.38am when he saw a vehicle that matched the description of the car involved in that shooting. 'He was driving slow, very suspicious,' Reynolds told the court. 'We locked eyes.' The car stopped and Tamerlan got out before pulling out a weapon on Reynolds, he testified. The police officer ducked and reversed - and then came the eight-minute gun battle. Ahead of the testimony, the jurors visited the boat where Tsarnaev was found. Tsarnaev, flanked by three attorneys and U.S. marshals, watched impassively from a table 50 feet away. The group then went two at a time onto a lift so they could look inside the vessel, which was on a trailer, to see the notes he scrawled on the walls before he was taken into custody on April 19, 2013. The red and white boat, the Slipaway II, was dry-docked in a yard in Watertown when he climbed inside. It is now covered with more than 100 bullet holes each marked with white evidence tape. In his notes written in pencil, Tsarnaev denounced the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. The note is speckled with at least 10 bullet holes and stained with long streaks of blood. Hideout: Tsarnaev, then 19, can be seen emerging from the boat after he was found on April 19, 2013 . Final words: Inside the boat, he wrote a series of notes, which the jury saw Monday. This note, punctured with bullets, explains how he is jealous of his brother Tamerlan because he had died and gone to paradise . The notes also\u00a0denounced the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. Last week, the jury heard how all the bullets that made holes in the side of the boat were shot from outside the vessel as he hid inside . 'We Muslims are one body you hurt one you hurt us all,' Tsarnaev scrawled, citing what it said was aggression in Muslim lands. 'We are promised victory and we will surely get it. Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in islam... but due to said [blank] it is allowed.' 'The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that. As a [unintelligible] I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all. Well at least that's how muhhammad (pbuh) wanted it to be [for]ever.

We are promised victory and we will surely get it. Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said [unintelligible] it is allowed. All credit goes [unintelligible]. Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.' 'I'm jealous of my brother who ha[s] [re]ceived the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) before me. I do not mourn because his soul is very much alive. God has a plan for each person. Mine was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions. I ask Allah to make me a shahied to allow me to return to him and be among all the righteous people in the highest levels of heaven. He who Allah guides no one can misguide. A[llah Ak]bar!' A word was missing from the message due to a bullet hole. In a separate, blood-covered note, he wrote that he was jealous of his older brother because he was dead and in paradise. 'God has a plan for each person,' he wrote. 'Mine was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions.' Last week, Todd Brown, a Boston police bomb technician, testified that he saw the writing inside the boat when he was sent to check it to make sure there were no explosives or booby traps on board. During cross-examination of Brown, Tsarnaev's lawyers established that all the bullet holes were from shots coming into the boat when police fired. The officer said no bombs, guns or weapons of any kind were found inside the boat. One of the boat's two front windows is shot out almost completely, with just one shattered piece of glass remaining. Tsarnaev is on trial for planning and carrying out the April 15, 2013 bombings and faces the death penalty if convicted. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two bombs exploded near the Boston marathon finish line. The blasts killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and eight-year-old Martin Richard, who was at the marathon with his family. Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 27, was shot dead three days later as the Tsarnaev brothers fled authorities. After the bombings, the brothers carjacked a man and hurled explosives at police during a shootout that ended when Dzhokhar roared off in a car, running over and killing his brother before disappearing into the dry-docked boat in the Boston suburb of Watertown. Plot: 23-year-old Tamerlan, pictured left, was killed during a shootout with police officers days after the bombings, while Dzhokhar, right, was found injured inside the boat and taken into custody . Police found him the next evening, after a day-long lockdown of the Boston area when hundreds of thousands of people hid in their homes. Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements of his trial that he participated in the bombings and the later crimes, but said his slain older brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind who recruited the then 19-year-old Dzhokhar to help him. But prosecutors say Tsarnaev was a full and willing participant. Now 21, he faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. The same jury that decides guilt will decide whether he receives life in prison or the death penalty. The trial began its third week on Monday. It had been expected to last three to four months but is moving faster than anticipated, largely because the defense has not cross-examined many witnesses.\n",

For the first time, scientists believe they are able to identify the point in a woman's cycle when there is the greatest chance an embryo will successfully implant in the womb. Repeated rounds of fertility treatment can prove emotionally and financially draining for couples desperate to become parents. There are more than 60,000 IVF cycles performed in the UK each year. Yet, just 24 per cent lead to live births. Meanwhile in the US, 175,000 IVF cycles were performed in 2013, according to the CDC. There, success rates ranged from 16 to 47 per cent, depending on a woman's age. Experts at the IVI fertility clinic in Madrid believe a new test, which identifies the point in a woman's cycle when there is the greatest chance an embryo will successfully implant, will help thousands of infertile couples realise their dream of becoming parents . While the NHS offers the treatment, strict guidelines mean many couples are forced to use private clinics, incurring bills that runs into thousands of pounds. The current treatment involves doctors performing an ultrasound to check the appearance of the lining of the womb, to assess its general health. It is known that for most women, there is a two to four day time period when the lining gives out the key chemical signals that allow the embryo to attach, leading to a pregnancy. But a team of scientists, led by Professor Juan Garcia Velasco at the IVI fertility clinic in Madrid, said they believe failed attempts often happen because an embryo is implanted at the wrong time, missing a woman's crucial window of fertility. They hope their new study will improve success rates for couples undergoing IVF, after they identified a test which can predict each woman's individual fertility window. Professor Garcia-Velasco, told MailOnline: 'The trial we are currently undertaking is trying to answer if the ERA test may help all couples from the first day they attend a fertility clinic, to detect endometrial defects. 'Or, if it will benefit only those with repeated implantation failure as the test does now. 'My hope is that this test will explain why some women do not get pregnant when good quality embryos are transferred, and thus, avoid repeated IVF failure. 'If we are able to select a good embryo and place in the uterus at the right time, success rates should be significantly higher. 'These tests are helping us doctors understand why IVF can be unsuccessful and ultimately reduce patients' frustration of unanswered questions.' He estimates around 15 per cent of cases of implantation failure 'are simply due to bad timing'. He added: 'I think it will make a significant difference in the expectations of couples and how we can explain failures. 'Until now, the endometrium was kind of a black box. Now we can say this was the problem and this is what we can do about it.' The test involves taking a biopsy of a woman's womb lining. Experts then analyse 238 genes, allowing them to determine when the woman's endometrium - the womb lining - will be most receptive to an implanted embryo. The test involves taking a biopsy of the womb lining, pictured under a microscope. Scientists are then able to analyse 238 genes to identify when the lining is at its most receptive and able to accept the embryo. A pilot study of 17 women, who had endured failed IVF attempts, saw nine become pregnant after the test . A case report detailing one woman's experience, followed by a pilot study involving 17 women, showed success rates were significantly improved after using the test. In the pilot study, none of the 17 women had become pregnant despite repeated (between one and six) rounds of IVF, when traditional techniques were used. But after the test was used to determine each woman's window of implantation, nine of the 17 became pregnant and went on to have a baby. It has previously been assumed that the window of implantation was 'constant in all women,' the researchers note. During IVF, an egg is surgically removed from a woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg, or embryo, is then returned and implanted back into the woman's womb to grow and develop. Embryo transfer is the final part of the treatment process, and as a result women will still have to go through a rigorous treatment programme to reach the point where they may benefit from the new test being trialled by Professor Juan Garcia Velasco. Step one . A woman is given a drug to suppress her natural menstrual cycle, often in the form of a daily injection or nasal spray, for around two weeks. Step two . A fertility hormone is given, again in the form of a daily injection for between 10 and 12 days. It increases the number of eggs a woman produces, to allow experts to collect and fertilise more eggs, to try and improve the success rate. Step three . Doctors then monitor the woman and around 34 to 38 hours before her eggs are due to be collected she will be given a final hormone injection that helps your eggs to mature. Step four . For the egg collection a woman is sedated and her eggs are collected using ultrasound as a guide. A needle is inserted through the vagina and into each ovary. The eggs are then collected through the needle. Step five . The collected eggs are mixed with the woman's partner's sperm and after 16 to 20 hours they are checked to see if any have been fertilised. If the sperm are few or weak, each egg may need to be injected with individual sperm. The fertilised eggs, embryos then continue to grow in the laboratory for one to five days before they are transferred back into the womb. Once the woman's eggs have been collected she is given medication, including progesterone, to help prepare the lining of the womb to receive an embryo. Step six . The embryos are transferred back into the woman's womb. It is at this point that the test being trialled by Professor\u00a0Garcia Velasco could be used to determine a woman's opportune fertility window. But their study has instead found that each woman has her own, individual window of implantation, when she can expect the best results from IVF. 'Understanding the \"molecular clock\" at play, regardless of the presence or absence of an embryo during the window of implantation could help to identify biomarkers of endometrial receptivity useful to create an objective personalised diagnostic test for this function,' the researchers said. Their case report details how a 39-year-old woman attended the clinic, reporting she had endured two failed attempts at IVF. Each round of IVF involved the transfer of two good quality embryos that failed to implant and a routine infertility assessment was normal. After counselling, the couple decided to pursue further rounds of IVF. But two subsequent rounds proved unsuccessful. The next step saw experts giving the woman hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as well as progesterone replacement. Three days after ovulation, triggered by the hormone therapy, another attempt failed. Another attempt five days after hormone therapy also proved unsuccessful. Despite the repeated failure, the couple remained determined to become pregnant. The researchers then attempted to diagnose the woman's window of implantation, using the endometrial receptivity array test (ERA). The test is based on the expression of 238 genes that are related to how receptive the womb lining is, established after a biopsy. 'The test identifies \"personalised\" window of implantation in women with recurrent implantation failure,' the report said. The team took a biopsy of the woman's womb lining five days after hormone therapy - the point at which the previous attempt had failed. It revealed her 'endometrium was pre-receptive', leading them to conclude they had been implanting the embryo too early. The report notes: 'A two-day displacement of her window of implantation was diagnosed, and this determined the need to repeat the ERA test in a further HRT cycle after seven days of progesterone replacement.' As a result, two embyros were implanted at the key seven-day point, after progesterone replacement, and the woman became pregnant with twins. The pregnancy was uneventful and twins boys were delivered by Caesarean section at 36 weeks. A pilot study followed with 17 patients taking part. Each had suffered between one and six implantation failures. The researchers diagnosed each woman's window of implantation and instead of routine embryo transfer, each woman underwent implantation according to her cycle. Of the women taking part nine became pregnant and gave birth. For one of the 17 women, six rounds of IVF had previously failed. Yet after performing the test, the researchers discovered all previous implantation attempts had been two days premature. After two further rounds of IVF, based on her individual cycle, the woman became pregnant and gave birth to her baby. Professor Garcia-Velasco is now leading a clinical trial of the test, with around 2,500 women who have suffered two or more failed attempts, in more than 10 countries taking part.\n",
        "output": "Experts at the IVI fertility clinic believe a new test could transform IVF .

West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham, was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. A spokesman for the force said: 'The operation was pre-planned and intelligence led. There was no immediate threat to public safety.' An 18-year-old man has been arrested at his home in Birmingham on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State (stock picture) West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham (stock picture), was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit . The man was arrested at his home address on suspicion of preparing for terrorist acts, contrary to Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006. It comes the day after it three\u00a0British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State fighters in Syria, in a dramatic security operation. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Istanbul after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned at a high-security London police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Last night they were released on bail. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'They have been bailed to return to a central London police station pending further inquiries.' Investigators hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so. Brent Council has confirmed that all three teenagers who have been bailed until a date in early May are from the north west London borough. It comes the day after it was revealed that three British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey, after a dramatic security operation stopped them joining Islamic State fighters in Syria . Council leader Muhammed Butt welcomed the quick actions of their families, saying that their decision to call authorities was 'vital' in getting the youngsters home safely. He said: 'It is good to know that these young men are now safely home with their families. This is because the families involved decided to call the authorities as soon as they realised their children were missing. 'This quick action was vital as it meant the police and border authorities were able to work effectively together to bring them home safe and sound. 'I would like to thank the Met Police and Turkish authorities for their swift action in returning the boys back to the UK in less than 48 hours.' He added that it was important for everyone in the community to work together to ensure people in danger of making the wrong choice get the guidance and support they need. Speaking in the Commons, Security Minister James Brokenshire said he could not comment on the specifics of the recent arrests but told MPs: 'It has been reported three young men were arrested at the weekend after attempting to travel from Turkey to Syria. 'This reflects the good working relationship we have with the Turkish authorities. 'MPs will understand I cannot comment on the specifics because there is an on-going investigation but I will say those seeking to travel to engage in terrorist activity in Syria or Iraq should be in no doubt we will take the strongest possible action to protect our national security, including prosecuting those who break the law.' MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the latest arrests suggest the flow of young people intending to travel to Syria is 'on a much larger scale than we envisaged'. 'I welcome the action that has been taken by the Turkish authorities,' he said. After meeting the boys' families, Mr Vaz said: 'The families of the two of the young men that I met are honourable, decent, hard-working British citizens who knew absolutely nothing about their sons' decisions. They acted swiftly, with the support of the leader of the council, to alert the police. 'The police need to be commended for the speed with which they dealt with this case. I have spoken to the Turkish ambassador to congratulate him on the action taken by the Turkish authorities. 'This is a rare good news story in the fight against terrorism and is a lesson to us all that we need to be vigilant against those who seek to groom our young men and women in this way.' It comes just weeks after an international police hunt was launched to find three London schoolgirls who travelled to Istanbul on their journey to Syria . Last week Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the three schoolgirls who fled to Syria from East London would not face prosecution if they came home. This is despite the fact they successfully reached IS and at least two of them are known to have communicated with wanted terrorists. The families of Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, have criticised police and others for failing to stop them. But questions have been raised about why the families themselves did not spot their conversion to radical Islam. The families of the three girls yesterday released a statement appealing for them to come home immediately. Saying they felt their loss 'more acutely' on Mother's Day, the families also criticised authorities, saying: 'With respect to the disappearance of our children we have been disappointed by the handling of this matter by the school, Met Police and the local authority, all of whom we feel failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information to us or indeed between each other.' On Saturday the Daily Mail revealed the identity of another girl, a close friend of the trio, who left Britain before them in December. Sharmeena Begum, 15, disappeared from Bethnal Green Academy and flew to Istanbul from Gatwick. Those closest to all four girls suspect they were groomed by Islamists using social networking sites and secretive internet messaging software. There are also suspicions the trio kept in touch with Sharmeena who passed on information about how to follow in her footsteps. The schoolgirls are understood to be in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa. The authorities in Turkey said the quick deportation of the latest travellers showed how their efforts to combat the flood of extremists is working. One source said: 'The Turkish are willing to act quickly and arrest people but they do not see this as their problem. That is why the suspects were sent back to the UK so quickly. No one here wants to deal with them any longer than they have to.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",

        "input": "Five bunker shots, four dropped shots, three missed putts from short range, two poor chips and one blow into the water. And that was just the front nine. It's fair to say Rory McIlroy's curious Florida funk continued in the opening round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday. At least on the back nine there were enough good blows on show to hint it will not be too long before we can enjoy a more customary service. The world number one had an eagle and three birdies in a blistering five hole spell to come home in 33 blows and salvage a 73. While that might have been barely ok in the coninput of the field as a whole it was a radical improvement on what appeared a likely score at halfway. McIlroy placed the blame on his outward half on being too tentative. 'After nine holes I thought there was really not much more to lose, so go ahead and be more aggressive,' he said. 'It paid off a little and the eagle was really important. Hopefully I can get off to a better start in the second round and get back into it.' Rory McIlroy hits a shot from the fairway during the first round of the Cadillac Championship in Florida . McIlroy lines up a putt on the 16th green during a difficult opening round for the world No 1 . McIlroy tries to play his way out a trouble after landing his shot in the bunker on the 17th hole . He's certainly got some work to do. McIlroy will start out no fewer than 11 shots off the pace set by former American Ryder Cup player JB Holmes. Given there was a decent breeze blowing for most of the day, his 62 was a remarkable effort. Fellow American Ryan Moore shot 66. World number three Henrik Stenson carded a 69 while Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up here last year, composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies. As for McIlroy, a desperately mediocre outward half of 40 strokes meant he had played his first 45 holes in the Sunshine State this year, taking in last week's two rounds at the Honda Classic, in a startling 11 over par. The world number one thought he had ironed out some difficulties he experienced in the wind last week but there was precious sign of it at this stage. World No 2 Bubba Watson plays his second shot on the 10th hole ad the American finished one under par . Henrik Stenson kept the heat on the leaders as the Swede finished the day's play three under par . Opening up from the tenth offered the chance of a flying start, since there are two par fives in the first three holes. But McIlroy drove into fairway bunkers on both to squander the chance for early gains. Just to compound the frustration, his approach to the par four 11th was a metre short of being perfect, and plugged in a greenside bunker to bring about an unlucky bogey. So it continued. Every good iron shot he played he couldn't take advantage, while every bad shot invariably led to more damage to his scorecard. Two over par coming to the 18th, McIlroy became another victim of this punishing hole as he found the water from the middle of the fairway with his approach, and failed to get up and down for a bogey from the side of the green. Welshman Jamie Donaldson composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies . It wasn't until his 13th hole that we got the first glimpse of the real Rory. A sumptuous long iron to the difficult par three fourth set up his first birdie of the day and lit the spark on a run that saw him birdie two of the next three holes before registering an eagle three at the 8th. Even during this spell, however, there were sloppy bogeys at the 5th and the 9th. No wonder he headed straight to the range afterwards. Two players who will not be remembering their rounds with any affection were Phil Mickelson and Stephen Gallacher. Mickelson's 74 was notable only for the fact it was the first time in 190 consecutive rounds on the PGA Tour that he had failed to register a single birdie. Poor Gallacher's nightmare was even more complete. The Scot put two balls into the water at the 18th to complete an awful 84. It was his worst competitive score in 455 events as a pro. Lee Westwood, who became the first man to play in 50 WGC events, was one over par after nine .\n",

        "input": "(CNN)It was a sophisticated attack with sophisticated devices. Authorities quickly identified the Boston bombing suspects, but almost immediately after Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during the manhunt for the perpetrators and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured, investigators privately questioned if more people were involved. If there were others, perhaps a bomb maker is on the loose. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told police he and his brother built the bombs, but court documents show some people involved in the case had their doubts. The bombs were described as powerful pressure-cooker explosives controlled remotely. There were fuses from Christmas lights and detonators constructed from model car parts. The twin bombings in April 2013 killed three people and wounded more than 250 others. \"These relatively sophisticated devices would have been difficult for the Tsarnaevs to fabricate successfully without training or assistance from others,\" prosecutors wrote in a filing opposing a move by Tsarnaev's lawyer to throw out statements he made in the hospital. Two years after the attack Michael Marks, a former special agent for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, agrees on the technical aspects of the bombs. \"These were two relatively sophisticated devices that went off almost simultaneously. They had a very, very short delay,\" he said. \"It would be my opinion that they had somebody who was more of a skilled bomb maker, an engineer if you will, assist them in saying these are the steps you need to go through and then assemble the device to make it safely and to make it function the way they want.\" They were the kind of bombs that need testing to make sure they work the way you expect. \"There has been no evidence that the two brothers actually tested and tried out making a bomb and detonating it,\" CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said. \"Now it could be luck that they put this thing together, put it at the Boston Marathon finish line, and were able to detonate them so close to each other and sequentially. But it was a pretty sophisticated attack.\" Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told FBI agents he and his brother built the bombs following instructions from al Qaeda's Inspire magazine. No one has been publicly named as a possible co-conspirator. Investigators have focused on Tamerlan Tsarnaev's suspected ties to militants. In 2012 the older Tsarnaev spent six months in Russia. Authorities have questioned how much exposure he may have had to radicals and whether he could have received training there. There are other clues that the brothers would have needed help with the bombs. There wasn't trace evidence -- black powder from fireworks -- found in either home, their cars or anywhere associated with them, the court documents said. Also, investigators apparently were troubled that they recovered one remote-controlled detonator at the scene of the bombings when there should have been two. That suggested the other was being kept to use with other bombs. Marks said investigators didn't find circuit testers. \"You want a separate circuit tester in order to test the functionality of the components without it being hooked up to the actual device, for your own safety,\" he said. The trial underway in Boston will center on not whether Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did it, but why he did it. The prosecution will paint a portrait of a cruel co-conspirator, an equal partner in hideous crimes. A man who planned to kill and did. But the defense will draw the accused as a boy living in the shadow of a mastermind older brother. Younger, struggling in school, abandoned by his parents. An easy victim of deep manipulation. The question of how he was influenced is essential to the case. Kayyem, who said she believes the brothers acted in tandem without outside help, said she think the defense strategy will be to create enough doubt within the jurors' minds of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's mental state leading into this. \"So this idea that there might be some evil hand out there telling Dzhokhar what to do -- whether it's his brother or someone who's a bomb maker -- fits nicely into that narrative,\" she said.\n",
        "output": "Investigators have always wondered if more people were involved in the bombings than just the brothers . Former Navy investigator: I think \"they had somebody who was more of a skilled bomb maker .. assist them\" There was no evidence the brothers ever tested their bombs before using them, CNN analyst says .\n"

Wales lost their first game of the 2015 championship to England in Cardiff but back-to-back wins in Scotland and France have put them back into title contention. Taulupe Faletau takes on the French defence during his side's victory in Paris in round three . '2013 was great and the win against England at the end was probably the most satisfying I've had,' said British and Irish Lions number eight Faletau.

'When the final whistle went against England it was amazing, but if we could replicate that it would probably be even better. 'Just doing it again I think would make it better.' Wales' title hopes seemed a distant dream when England recovered from a first-half deficit in the tournament opener to run out 21-16 winners.

In a post on Reddit, Fraley previously noted that he felt guilty about releasing his videos to the public, because they show his beloved mother 'at her worst' and he felt, to a certain extent, as though he was exploiting her illness. 'Part of me felt like it would be exploiting my mom and letting strangers see her at her worst,' he wrote. 'She was a college professor and after she was let go from her job she was very self-conscious of people thinking she was stupid.' But in the end he said he was glad he posted the videos because 'people have said such nice things and it promotes awareness of such a horrible disease. 'My dad and three siblings are proud as well.' The Fraley family are currently raising money via the crowdfunding site GoFundMe to pay for Mrs Fraley's medical treatment. Any remaining funds will be\u00a0donated to the Alzheimer's Association in her name.\n",

        "input": "This is the moment a group of 20 drunken thugs stormed a synagogue before hurling anti-Semitic abuse including 'Kill the Jews' at young worshippers inside. The dramatic brawl broke out after the group forced their way into the Ahavas Torah synagogue in Stamford Hill, north London, where young people were marking the end of the sabbath. The attack, which led to\u00a0four men and two women being arrested, comes amid concerns about an increase of anti-Semitic attacks across Europe. A Jewish patrol group, which works to reduce violence against Jews, said it had stepped up patrols in the area. This is the moment a group of 20 drunken thugs stormed a synagogue in north London before hurling anti-Semitic abuse including 'Kill the Jews' at young worshippers inside . In a shocking video filmed at the scene, chairs are seen being flung against the double doors, shattering panes of glass, as men shout profanities at those desperately barricading the doors. Those inside then start to fight back by throwing parts of broken chairs around the synagogue. This morning, a mound of broken furniture and trails of blood could be seen strewn across the building. The incident is said to have taken place after the group attacked a young Jewish man outside the building, who is not a member of the synagogue. As he ran inside for refuge, the thugs chased him inside. Police said some of the men did manage to briefly break into the synagogue, but were quickly thrown out again by security staff. One man was injured as he sought to prevent the group from getting in. He sustained facial injuries, not believed to be serious. He was treated at the scene and did not require hospital treatment. Police said the attack was not linked to Neo Nazis or Islamic extremists but was 'the completely unacceptable actions of a drunken group.' A spokesman for Scotland Yard said : 'At this early stage, there is no suggestion that this was a far-right or extremist attack but rather the completely unacceptable actions of a drunken group. 'Four men and two women were arrested for public order offences and assault. All were taken to a north London police station where they remain in custody. The dramatic brawl broke out after the group forced their way into the Ahavas Torah synagogue in Stamford Hill while young worshippers were marking the end of the sabbath . 'Shomrin volunteers provided assistance to attending officers, helping with statements and the recovery of local CCTV footage.' Several elders were convinced the attack was not religiously motivated and was merely a typical example of anti-social behaviour. David Mocha, 15, went down to the synagogue this morning to clear up after last night's violence. Many of his friends were inside the synagogue at the time and one had his head smashed with a broken window. He said: 'The Rabbi was telling me this was not an anti-Semitic attack but a fight outside that just got out of hand. 'But from what my friends have told me this was definitely an anti-Semitic attack. People were shouting 'kill the Jews'. I've seen videos of them chanting that. You can't say that's not anti-Semitic. In a shocking video filmed at the scene, chairs are flung against the double doors, shattering panes of glass.\u00a0The men can also be heard shouting profanities at those barricading the building . 'One of my friends had a window smashed in his face. People were bleeding. There was blood and broken chairs all over the place when I came to clear up, it was much worse than it is now. 'I don't feel safe at all. My friends said they were terrified by what happened last night. I'm so scared sometimes I try to hide my Jewish identity.' Yuri Simon, also a member of the synagogue, said his friends were also inside the building when the attack happened. He said: 'This was obviously an anti-Semitic attack. My friends were inside the synagogue and I got a call from them saying what was happening. 'I was told there was an incident outside between a young man and a private party who were drunk. 'He went inside and they started attacking the synagogue, breaking the windows and forced their way inside. People were bleeding. The police arrested them. There were about 20 drunk people. 'There has been an increase in anti-Semitic incidents, people feel free to attack. There needs to be more security and tougher punishments. Some of the men did manage to go into the synagogue but were quickly thrown out again by security staff . Elders, including Rabbi Maurice Davis are convinced the attack was not religiously motivated and was merely a typical example of anti-social behaviour . 'My friends were terrified by what happened, it's shocking. I think more incidents like this is the future in Britain. I don't feel safe in this neighbourhood any more.' Meir Taub, who is a member of the local Shomrim, a Jewish patrol designed to crack down on violence against Jews, said he was called to the incident shortly after it began and was the first to call the police. He said: 'I came down and there was a huge group of people, men and women, trying to force their way into the synagogue. 'The window had already been smashed. Teenagers were shouting abuse. It was blatantly anti-Semitic, they came and attacked a synagogue. 'I was on the phone to the police all the time, I didn't interfere but others did. 'The number of these incidents has increased in the past few months, since before Charlie Hebdo. We're stepping up patrols and working with the police. The courts should take attacks like this seriously. A Jewish patrol designed to crack down on violence against Jews said it would be stepping up patrols and that attacks such as this should be taken seriously . 'I have clear footage which I'm going to show to the police which clearly shows there were anti-Semitic chants.' Bernard Grosskopf, who lives close to the synagogue, went to see what was happening after being woken up by the noise of the fight. He said: 'It was quite something. Both groups were going at each other. The fight was crazy, it was pandemonium. I didn't get the feeling it was anti-Semitic though, just a normal fight.' Rabbi Maurice Davis said the first thing he heard about the incident was when he was contacted by the media this morning and asked for a comment. He said he was '200 per cent' sure the attack was a normal Saturday night brawl and was not religiously motivated in any way. He said: 'I've spoken to the patrol and looked at videos. It was depressing what happened but it definitely wasn't anti-Semitic.\u00a0There is no anti-Semitism or racism in this area. 'There was a party across the road, they are a nice family, I know them. They had a fight with a young man in the street who ran into the synagogue and took refuge in the toilet. 'He was Jewish but not a member of the synagogue. Some of the drunken partygoers tried to break in and attack him but they were beaten back with chairs. They smashed windows and threw all sorts of things. 'I don't know yet what the cost of the damage is, but we will have to replace the door.' Four men and two women were arrested for public order offences and assault. All were taken to a north London police station where they remain in custody. A police spokesman said: 'The disturbance began when a group of drunk males, believed to have walked to the area from a house party nearby, tried to gain access to the synagogue in Craven Park Road. 'One man was injured as he sought to prevent the group from entering the building. He sustained facial injuries, not believed to be serious, and was taken to hospital for treatment. 'A small number of the group did briefly gain entry to the synagogue before being removed by security staff.' They added: 'The incident is being treated as an anti-Semitic incident, due to remarks made by one of the group. However there is nothing to suggest that it was a planned or targeted attack. Inspector Jonathan Waterfield said: 'We are investigating to establish the full circumstances of the incident and to identify anyone else involved in the disturbance who has not yet been arrested. 'We have also increased police patrols in the Stamford Hill area to provide reassurance to the community.' The Community Security Trust, which monitors anit-Semitic incidents, tweeted: 'We are aware of alleged antisemitic assault at synagogue in Stamford Hill & are working w. Police & community. Suspects have been arrested.' Police have asked anyone with information which might assist the investigation to call Haringey CID via 101.

        "input": "A victim of child sex abuse herself, former child star Sarah Monahan has weighed into the furore surrounding the Royal Commission into the reporting of child sex abuse, focussing most recently at the elite Knox Grammar School. Monahan was sexually abused as a child by Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes, who was jailed last May for a minimum of six years. On her blog, sarahmonahan.com, the former TV star brought to light the reaction of some people to the allegations against private boy's school Knox Grammar, slamming those who claimed the young boys deserved what they got. 'The Royal Commission into Child Abuse has been uncovering a lot of horrific stories of abuse in Australia,' her post began. Scroll down for video . Former child star Sarah Monahan has voiced her opinions on the Royal Commission into Child Abuse . 'I think while it\u2019s devastating that so many people have been abused, and some of their stories are heart wrenching, some of the reactions to the abuse have been much worse,' Ms Monahan continued. 'Hearing people discuss the abuse at Knox Grammar has kind of shocked me. There are plenty of people online who seem to imply that these kids deserved it because their parents sent them to a fancy pants grammar school.' Ms Monahan, whose claims against Robert Hughes were a catalyst into the investigations which eventually saw him locked up, also recounted her own private school experiences in the strongly-worded post. 'To suggest that the parents of these kids are to blame because they were more interested in sending their kids to a grammar school than a state school is appalling, she also wrote. 'I don\u2019t care if you have a beef with private schools getting money from the government. I don\u2019t care if you once hated a kid who went to a private school. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re secretly jealous that you didn\u2019t get to attend a private school. Ms Monahan's (centre, front) claims against Robert Hughes (left, front) were a catalyst into the investigations which eventually saw him behind bars . 'Nobody, and I mean nobody, deserves to be abused. Whether you\u2019re a millionaire\u2019s daughter attending Ascham, a janitors kid on a free scholarship at Knox, or a middle class kid attending the local state high school. No matter your status, or income bracket, all children deserve to grow up, free of abuse,' Monahan's piece concluded. Her abuser, Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was sentenced last May after being convicted of 10 child sex offences, committed between 1983 and 1991. Before a packed gallery at the Sydney District Court, Judge Peter Zahra said Hughes had not expressed remorse. 'His conduct continued over 20 years. [Even] after he was questioned by police in 1986 it continued,' he said. 'The offender took advantage of when he was with victims in social settings in his home or at victims' homes. 'He lacks insight into his offending and he is unlikely to access treatment programs.' Ms Monahan (left) was one of the first to speak out against Hughes (right), and in a recent blog post addressed the discussion surrounding Knox Grammar . Once he was found guilty, Monahan reacted to the news by saying she was 'happy' and that she hopes Hughes now 'realises he's a bad man' Monahan's most recent comments come following last week's revelations that former head of Knox Grammar Ian Paterson denied touching a young woman's bottom during a school musical to the cheering of young boys, as he admitted deliberately hindering a 1996 investigation into child sex abuse. In the second shocking day of evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse, Dr Paterson said he did 'absolutely not' touch Lucy Perry, who was 15-years-old, during a rehearsal of 'Guys and Dolls' in 1989. 'They were roaring their approval for her performance as the sultry dancer,' Dr Paterson told the inquiry, under intense questioning from counsel assisting the commission David Lloyd. Dr Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Knox Grammar, provided evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse last week . Lucy Perry, the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson had touched her behind during a rehearsal of Guys and Dolls. She said the action was greeted by a 'roar of approval' from young men in the crowd . Lucy Perry was surprised by the reaction her testimony triggered from victims attending the inquiry, with many standing up to applaud her as she left . In explosive testimony on Wednesday, Dr Paterson also accepted he had hindered a police investigation of claims into child sex abuse led by Inspector Elizabeth Cullen in 1996. He said on Wednesday that when a police inspector from the child protection unit approached him in 1996 about six teachers at Knox about whom there had been complaints, he did not give her full information. In reply to David Lloyd counsel advising the royal commission, which is inquiring into Knox's handling of sex abuse complaints, Dr Paterson agreed he knew this would impede the investigation. Ms Perry, 41, now the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson, the show's producer, had singled her out during the joint rehearsal between Knox and Roseville College. As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. 'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission. 'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and (I) felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' Knox Grammar former headmaster Ian Paterson said on Tuesday that he is 'deeply and profoundly sorry' for failing to recognise and respond to child sex abuse perpetrated while he was head of the school . Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student . Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering. 'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.' Ms Perry was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009. An arrest warrant has been issued for former Knox teacher Christopher Fotis after he failed to appear at a royal commission hearing last Tuesday . 'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said. His testimony followed a day of evidence on Tuesday where it emerged Dr Paterson allowed teachers he knew had abused children to stay on staff for years. Others he suspected of sexually abusing students were allowed to\u00a0resign and Dr Paterson wrote them positive letters of recommendation following their departures. The hearing on Tuesday also heard that the student files of abuse victims went missing from the school, and no detailed records of sex abuse allegations relating to teachers and students were recorded in their files. Dr Paterson said Knox conducted a number of internal investigations into abuse suffered by students without reporting the cases the authorities, but repeatedly denied that incidences were kept from police or DOCs to protect the school's reputation. He said he made the decision not to sack one teacher who watched hardcore pornography with students in 1987 because the man had 'made a very silly mistake' and had 'enormous potential in the profession'. In a case involving another teacher in 1987, Dr Paterson said he sent a 15-year-old student to the library to 'think about what he said' after the teen confided in him about being abused - describing the student as a 'dramatical boy' who 'liked to exaggerate stories'. Purple ribbons were tied out the front of Knox Grammar School in honour of victims of paedophile teachers . Dr Paterson read out a statement apologising for his failings at the beginning of the commission's hearing in Sydney today . Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student in 1988. He added that he did not think to report the matter to police even after he formed a suspicion the attack was perpetrated by a staff member. On Tuesday, Dr Paterson was questioned about former teacher Craig Treloar who worked at the school until 2009 despite Dr Paterson being aware of the pornography incident that occurred in 1987. Treloar was convicted of child sex abuse in 2010 and sentenced to jail for two years. Dr Paterson said former Knox general duties master Stuart Pearson called him late in 1987 and told him Treloar had shown pornography to a young student. He said he had not asked any further details, including how many boys were shown the tape, how often it had occurred or if he'd propositioned any boys. The hearing continues.

        "input": "A possessive boyfriend who beat his petite girlfriend to death while shouting 'log on, log on' after becoming obsessed with the idea that she was having an affair on Facebook has been jailed for life. Kane Boyce, 34, brutally murdered Paula Newman, 20, in New Addington, south London, after she refused to hand over a password to one of her social media accounts. He stamped on her head and nearby residents heard piercing screams as he attacked her and shouted: 'If you don't log on, we'll see what happens.' Kane Boyce, 34, (left) has been jailed for life for murdering his 20-year-old girlfriend Paula Newman (right) by beating her and stamping on her head in south London, after she refused to hand over her Facebook password . Following the brutal attack, which caused Miss Newman to suffer a major haemorrhage, Boyce drove her to a friend's house where he showered her as she slipped in and out of consciousness. He failed to call an ambulance until the following morning and she was taken to hospital where she died from her injuries. Boyce, an electrician from Erith, southeast London, has now been jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years before parole. The jury was told that while Boyce had the ability to charm women, he had a history of being manipulative, controlling and extremely violent to his partners. The Old Bailey heard how he admitted manslaughter in relation to Ms Newman's death but was found guilty of murder following a trial by jury. Sentencing Boyce, Judge Paul Worsley QC said he was 'controlling, obsessive and violent' towards women. He said: 'The attack was a sustained and brutal assault using fists and feet and your superior force. 'I regard you as a man who has demonstrated that you are a danger to young women who form relationships with you. 'Paula was a vulnerable woman. Besotted by you, she was only 20 and you were 13 years her senior, almost a foot taller and you weighed some seven stone more than she did. 'You had a history of violence and controlling behaviour towards her. 'You have a record of cowardly attacks towards other women going back 15 years.' Boyce, wearing a pink shirt and grey blazer, stared straight ahead impassively as he was sentenced. The court heard how he flew into a fit of rage on November 12, 2013, when Miss Newman stopped him from reading her online messages and refused to hand over her Facebook password. The Old Bailey heard how Boyce was 'obsessed' with looking at Miss Newman's Facebook account because he suspected she was cheating on him . He was 'obsessed' with looking at her Facebook account because he suspected she was cheating on him, the Old Bailey heard. He claimed they both accessed each other's Facebook accounts to 'give each other lives' on the Candy Crush mobile phone game. 'You get four lives an hour or something,' he said. 'I went on her phone to send myself a life so I could carry on playing.' On the evening of the murder, he attacked Ms Newman in his car and then followed her as she tried to escape to a nearby field in the New Addington area of south London. Neighbours heard 'piercing female screams' as he pushed her to the ground, hit her and stamped on her face, causing a major haemorrhage. He then bundled his girlfriend back into his car and drove her to a friend's house where he showered her and left her lying naked on the bed. At 6am the next morning, he drove to a stretch of road and collected Miss Newman's shoe and body warmer from beside a fence. When he returned home, paramedics were finally called, but Miss Newman could not be saved. Following her death, Boyce lied about the attack and claimed she had suffered a fit. He also destroyed any evidence linking him to the crime. Prosecutor Gillian Etherton, QC, said: 'This defendant is a man who is jealous, obsessive, controlling, and violent. 'The defendant, in a violent rage, beat and it would appear kicked or stamped on Paula's head causing her severe and irreparable brain injury which brought about her death.' The court heard how Miss Newman had been planning to leave Boyce in the weeks before her death. 'It appears that at the beginning of their relationship, the defendant treated Paula well and gave her gifts, but within a few months this changed', she said. 'The relationship was up and down to say the very least. 'By the end of the summer, Paula was confiding in those close to her that they were serious problems in the relationship, they were arguing, she told those close to her that the defendant was controlling, abusive and possessive and she was unhappy.' Stefani Taylor, a friend of Miss Newman, told police: 'He had complete control of her and I have never seen her like that before. 'I pleaded with her to leave him but she would always say she loved him.' Miss Newman, who was five foot three inches tall and weighed under nine stone, started dating Boyce just seven months before he killed her and they first shared a house in Beckenham, London. The court heard how she told a friend four days before her death that she wanted to move out, and asked for help removing her possessions to avoid Boyce noticing until she had actually left. 'Paula also confided in her niece Nicola Newman that the defendant wanted her to stay in the house all the time - she felt like a prisoner', Ms Etherton said. Boyce, 34, was jailed for life, to serve a minimum jail term of 20 years, at the Old Bailey in London (pictured) Ms Etherton added that the day before her death, Boyce was heard complaining that Miss Newman would not let him into her Facebook account. 'In the weeks prior to Paula's death, and indeed at the time of her death, this defendant became obsessed with getting access to Paula's Facebook accounts', she said. Boyce told a friend: 'I've asked her for this Facebook account and she won't give it over to me for love nor money.' He also posted online: 'I knew she was f****** cheating on me, lying cheating slag', the court heard. In sentencing Boyce, Judge Worsley said Miss Newman 'had her life ahead of her'. He told the court: 'She was a much-loved member of her family. 'You ended that life when you lost your temper with her because you disapproved or disagreed with her Facebook friends. 'You were controlling abusive and violent. 'You attacked her on the edge of a housing estate when she got out of the car to escape your violence. You took her to the ground and you beat her and kicked her and she sustained a subdural haemorrhage. 'There is evidence of a stamp and a mark of an upper trainer could have caused the mark to her face. 'You failed to call an ambulance because you feared that they would recognise the bruising on her face chest and arms as signs of violence. You tried to conceal what had happened.' The judge described Boyce's explanation in court as 'another tissue of lies' and added: 'You have lied throughout in an attempt to save your skin.' Boyce shook his head as he was led down to the cells. In a victim impact statement, Miss Newman's brother Gary Newman said her four brothers were wracked by guilt that they could not protect their younger sister. He said: 'Losing Paula has left my family feeling sad, shocked, cheated and devastated. 'The incident has totally destabilised my family and it is a day to day struggle for each member of our family. 'We are all devastated and confused and want to know the truth about what happened to our sister.' Mr Newman said Miss Newman was 'the baby of the family' and described her as 'an amazing person.' He added: 'Paula was a lovely beautiful girl who we saw growing into a beautiful young woman. 'We were just starting to feel that Paula was standing on her own two feet. 'When the family gets together it doesn't feel the same anymore because Paula isn't there. 'She should have lived a long, healthy, happy life. She had a kind, carrying nature and was always there for you. 'It hurts to think that all we have are memories of her, and won't get the chance to hold her and hug her again.' 'We know that nothing will ever bring her back but the family are putting their faith in the judicial system and can only hope that Kane Boyce gets his just rewards.'\n",

Co-owner Fergie and Nicholls were so keen for the Ditcheat trainer\u2019s head lad Clifford Baker to ride the winner that his fancied mount Rainy City, who cost \u00a3100,000, had exploited the grey areas of eligibility for the last race on the Festival card yesterday. The regulations, confirmed by a Cheltenham spokeswoman, state that horses in the line-up should all have been given an average BHA rating to ensure a competitive race. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and Paul Nicholls (left) were at Cheltenham to watch Rainy City finish fifth . Yet Rainy City, who is highly thought of in the Nicholls yard, had no BHA rating, and rival jockeys were concerned that Fergie\u2019s horse was far superior to the rest of the field. The get-out clause buried in the fine print was that any horse without a rating could be handicapped by Cheltenham at their discretion. In the event, Rainy City finished an outpaced fifth, having led for most of the 1m 5f. Nicholls said: \u2018Of course we wanted to win. But it\u2019s a charity race and we entered to give Clifford a ride.\u2019 Arena Racing Company, who own racecourses that stage 40 per cent of UK fixtures, still chose to hold their annual drinks party during Cheltenham, even though it is not one of their tracks.

The statue of Sekhemka, a limestone figure which is just 30in high, was controversially sold by Northampton Borough Council for \u00a315.76m last year to a mystery buyer abroad. But the council was accused of committing \u2018a great act of folly\u2019 by The Save Sekhemka Statue Action group, who feared the ancient relic could disappear into private ownership overseas. Sold: The statue of Sekhemka (pictured at Christie's, London last year), a limestone figure which is just 30in high, was controversially sold by Northampton Borough Council for \u00a315.76million to a mystery buyer abroad . Now the culture minister Ed Vaizey has ordered a four-month export ban on the relic leaving the British Isles after Arts Council England ruled the sale breached standards for how museums manage their collections. That ban could even be extended to March 2016 if a \u2018serious intention to raise funds to purchase the statue is made\u2019, Arts Council England said. The statue, which dates from 2,400BC, is a tomb model of a kilt-wearing high official surrounded by his wife, son and seven offering bearings. Mr Vaizey praised the figure as a work of \u2018outstanding aesthetic importance\u2019, and \u2018the finest example of its kind anywhere in the world.\u2019 Treasure: The statue, which dates from 2,400BC, is a tomb model of a kilt-wearing high official surrounded by his wife, son and seven offering bearings. Above, the artifact picture in Christie's last year . But in July last year the council sold off the piece, which they have owned for more than 100 years, insisting it wasn\u2019t the centrepiece of their collection. The Egyptian government called on the statue to be returned to Egypt if Northampton did not want it, and said the sale ran counter to the values and role of museums worldwide. A Northampton council spokesman said the export ban had \u2018no impact\u2019 on the council\u2019s sale of the statue \u2013 and insisted it was a matter for the government and Arts Council England to resolve between them. Tomb model: The statue of Sekhemka, on display at Christie's, London, ahead of its sale last year . The statue of Sekhemka was found during a 19th century archaeological dig near Cairo. The tomb model shows a seated man wearing a kilt and wig, with his wife, son and offering-bearers. Sekhemka was a high level scribe who lived in the Old Kingdom sometime between 2,700BC and 2,2250BC - the period of Egyptian history when the pyramids of Giza were built. In a country that was mainly illiterate, his ability to read and write means he would have been a person of high status with access to high offices. At first, tomb statues - a sign of wealth - were reserved for the royal family. But as the economy improved, officials like Sekhemka who held high-ranking positions could afford to pay craftsmen to create likenessess of themselves for their tomb. They served two purposes: to act as a record of the way the person looked, and to ensure that the offerings he desired for his survival in the afterlife - listed on the papyrus carried in the statue's hands - were made after his death. It is unkown exactly when the statue arrived at Northampton Museum, but records indicate it was on display before the end of the 1890s. It has been on display at various Norhampton museums until two years ago. The statue, which stands just 30in high, has been praised as a work of 'outstanding aesthetic importance' by culture minister Ed Vaizey. He added it was 'the finest example of any kind in the world'. Its sale in July last year - a bid to raise money to extend Northampton's museum and art gallery - was heavily criticised.\n",

The rapper's hit song can be heard playing in the background as Gilbow, the house mother of the University of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon house -- known as Mom B. -- repeats the n-word seven times on camera. It appears overboard considering that the hook of the song, \"All Gold Everything,\" uses the word only three times per succession. Gilbow has been bombarded with claims that she's just as racist as the fraternity members caught singing a racist song on a bus last weekend. It's an allegation she's firmly denied, and the Atlanta rapper who wrote \"All Gold Everything\" is willing to give her a pass, though he wouldn't condone her use of the word. He doesn't hate her, though. \"I'm not going to be that person,\" he told CNN. \"It's a rock and a hard place. I can't be as upset at that lady. I'm upset at the fraternity because what they're saying is a chant that's just completely disrespectful to the black race. As far as that lady goes -- man, that's an old lady, man. Let that lady be.\" The Trinidad-born rapper, whose real name is Nicholas Williams, said he doesn't like giving interviews about race and the n-word because his views are complex and hip-hop stars can be hypocrites when it comes to the topics. \"It's hard to ridicule somebody for something that you continue to use in your music,\" he said. \"Every (hip-hop) artist is using the n-word in their music -- hit records with the n-word in it. You can't be upset when somebody says it. You can't. It's hard to differentiate when you can use it. If we don't want the word used and the word holds such a negative connotation, then we shouldn't use it at all, period.\" He compared it to children hearing their parents curse, \"and they told you not to curse. You wanted to curse. You cursed.\" Coninput matters, he said. If you're using the word in a negative way, talking down to someone or being sarcastic, that's wrong. \"But if it's somebody that you've been rocking with or we're listening to music or whatever, I can't be upset,\" he said. \"It's humanly impossible for you to be upset at a different race saying it when you're saying it in your music. That's crazy to me.\" He has a different take on the fraternity members caught clapping, pumping their fists and chanting, \"There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me.\" SAE no stranger to scandal . \"I don't respect that at all. What kind of world are we living in here?\" he asked. He took it personally, he said, because he and other hip-hop artists travel the country to perform for fraternities, and to know any fraternity member would harbor such vile feelings toward him \"burns my heart.\" As fellow Atlanta rapper Waka Flocka Flame noted when he canceled an upcoming show for the University of Oklahoma SAEs, Trinidad James said people of all races attend his concerts and have a great time together. \"These fraternities are places that us as hip-hop artists, we come and do amazing shows for these fraternities, like I just did Texas Tech, I just did Texas A&M, Delta Chi, Sigma Chi, and those guys were great. And I've done a show actually at Oklahoma last year,\" he said. \"So to see that that chapter feels that type of way toward the black race, it hurts, man. It sucks.\" He even takes a special pride in performing in front of these audiences, he said. \"We go really hard for these college kids. I didn't go to college, so for me, I feel really good when I can make kids who are doing the right thing and going to college ... have a good time because college is so strenuous on the mind and it's so hard when you've got to pay tuition and books, trying to survive as a young adult, so that's why we try to come and make sure the kids have a great time. If you go look at the shows, it's an amazing time.\" As far as the chances that he'd ever perform in front of Oklahoma's SAE chapter in the future, forget about it, he said. He doesn't care if they were resurrected as an all-black fraternity, he said. \"I don't want nothing to do with that because that's ridiculous. I feel like anything they do now is just to cover it up and make it look better,\" he said. And while it's disturbing to see young people voicing racist leanings, Trinidad James said he'd prefer to know where someone stands over being misled. Fraternities considering booking him in the future can keep that in mind, he said. \"I would rather you didn't even book me for the shows. I'm not no hired monkey,\" he said. \"Just don't be cool with me. Don't talk to me. If you feel that way about me that you would want to hang me from a tree then don't talk to me. I would stay away from you because obviously my skin color offends your life.\" CNN's Nick Valencia conducted the interview from Norman, Oklahoma, and Eliott C. McLaughlin wrote from Atlanta.\n",

Apple phones are designed to ward off hackers by locking the phone after too many incorrect attempts at entering a passcode. But a team of experts has found a way to bypass this security feature using a DIY hacking kit made from parts bought online. The gadget plugs into a phone and simulates the PIN entry over USB meaning it can bruteforce every possible combination until it finds the correct one. Importantly, by connecting directly to the phone's power source, it can override the 'Erase data after 10 attempts' setting. The hack and device was devised by experts from London-based MDSec, authors of The Mobile Application Hacker's Handbook. It takes advantage of a flaw in iOS 8.1 that creates a tiny delay between the PIN code being entered and the phone unlocking. MDSec's device cuts the power source immediately after each failed attempt but before the attempt has been synchronised with the phone's flash memory.

MDSec's total setup cost around \u00a3200 ($297), and the researchers explained that because each PIN entry takes approximately 40 seconds - including the phone shutting down - it can take more than four days to bruteforce a four-digit code. The hack also only works if a criminal has stolen or found the phone, and it only applies to phones running iOS 8.1 or older.

She said: 'Is it romantic when somebody tracks your phone, when somebody knows where you live before you tell them, sells your only means of transport, or buys the company you work for? 'How can you marry that with being romantic?' Ms Collins, who is a consultant working to end the abuse of women, said that after reading all three books, she was left 'deeply concerned about the amount of domestic violence that was being romanticised and celebrated'. She added: 'The thing that I would say to people who are reading the books, who are going to see it, is, if he wasn't rich and very attractive, would this behaviour be normal?' Domestic violence campaigners in America and the UK called for a boycott of the film when it was released last month because they believed it 'glorified' and 'romanticised' abuse against women . The books, written by EL James, follow the sado-masochistic sexual relationship between the two protagonists, Seattle billionaire Christian Grey and demure student Anastasia Steele. Ms Collins said the campaign group were not against the sexual nature of the book but there were other far more worrying themes in the novel . 'We are not against BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism), it is the other issues in the books and films which we say glamorise domestic violence. 'I have spoken to people who have said that he (Christian Grey) was abused as a child and that is why he is the way he is. 'It is also very dangerous to suggest that people abuse because of their childhood and that women can fix broken men with enough love.'\n",

        "input": "Dick Advocaat\u2019s appointment as Sunderland boss seemed complete on Monday night after he told Dutch TV that he had signed a contract until the end of the season. The 67-year-old will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season and his package will be incentivised with the target of survival. Advocaat told Voetbal International: 'I am now in a dark hotel, but soon I'll be working in the Stadium of Light.' Dick Advocaat, pictured here in charge of PSV Eindhoven in 2012, is set to take charge at Sunderland . Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone . Sunderland supporters turned on manager Poyet after their side were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. Advocaat could land up to \u00a3500,000 if the Black Cats \u2013 currently one point above the relegation zone \u2013 avoid the drop. He will bring with him Montenegrin coach Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010. It is unlikely, however, that Advocaat will be considered as the permanent successor to Gus Poyet, who was sacked yesterday after 17 months at the Stadium of Light. Sportsmail\u00a0understands that West Ham manager Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement are at the top of the club's shortlist to take charge beyond this season. Clement, in particular, fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club, where sporting director Lee Congerton has control over transfers. Clement and Congerton know each other from their time at Chelsea and the Real No 2 is thought to be keen to try his hand as a manager back in England. Meanwhile, it is Congerton's contacts book which has led to talks with Advocaat. Former Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen \u2013 who worked with Advocaat at PSV Eindhoven and Congerton at Stamford Bridge and then Hamburg \u2013 has recommended him for the role and he will be installed before Saturday's trip to West Ham. Advocaat could land up to \u00a3500,000 if the Black Cats \u2013 one point above the drop zone \u2013 avoid relegation . 'This is something I always wanted to do, the Premier League. The Premier League is a phenomenal competition,' Advocaat told AD Sportwereld. 'As a manager that is where you want to work, that has such a pulling power. 'Saturday, West Ham awaits. And then there's the international break. And then \u2013 the derby with Newcastle United. That is really something to look forward to because believe me, this just is a very big club.' Sunderland owner Ellis Short moved swiftly to dismiss Poyet during a telephone conversation after training on Monday. It is understood the Uruguayan asked for his contract \u2013 which expires in 2016 \u2013 to be paid up in full after he was informed that his position had become untenable. Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010, will work alongside Advocaat . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce could be the long-term successor to Poyet at the Stadium of Light . His assistant Mauricio Taricco and first-team coach Charlie Oatway are also set to leave the club. Former Sunderland favourites and academy coaches Kevin Ball and Paul Bracewell will now be on hand to help at senior level. Short acted on the advice of the influential Congerton and chief executive Margaret Byrne in getting rid of Poyet. They felt there was no way back for the head coach following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa. Supporters tried to storm the dugout and also let their feelings be known to those seated in the directors' box. The decision was soon made to dispense with Poyet and contact initiated with Advocaat, who left his post as Serbia national team manager in November after just five months in charge. His first home game will be the visit of North-East rivals Newcastle on Easter Sunday.\n",

The 31-year-old Australian, who is currently awaiting execution on the island of Nusakambangan, asked his girlfriend Febyanti Herewila if she would be his wife when she visited him in Kerobokan prison in February. Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death by Indonesian president Joko Widodo. Febyanti and Chan met each other in Kerobokan prison in 2012 after a friend introduced the pair. The Indonesian had been visiting the prison as part of her role as a pastor and Chan was carrying out theological studies in the hope of becoming a minister. Since then they have dreamed of his release, even talking about plans to have children together one day. Convicted drug smuggler Andrew Chan proposed to his girlfriend Febyanti Herewila (pictured with ring) of three years when he discovered his clemency bid had been rejected by Indonesian authorities. Febyanti Herewila Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph\u00a0Febyanti claimed she is totally in love with Chan and she did not accept his proposal out of pity for the Bali Nine prisoner. 'I love him for who he is. And I see what he does for other people and that makes me love him more,' Febyanti said. 'If you ask me why do I love him, it's because he also has weaknesses as well but he also has a lot of good things about him. I accept him the way he is. I am also very proud of him.' Chan was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.2kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years and got a new lease of life in 2012 when he met the love of his life. Febyanti pictured here with Andrew Chan's brother, Michael Chan, was turned away from visiting Kerobokan Prison just before the Bali Nine duo were escorted to Nusakambangan to await their execution .

On the day Chan proposed, the happy couple sat around the prison eating cake and celebrating by praying for his release. Febyanti and Chan's brother attempted to visit him one last time in Kerobokan prison last Wednesday before his transfer to the Indonesian 'death island' but were denied access. On Monday, Febyanti was one of a selected number of family members who visited Chan on Nusakambangan island. Along with fellow Bali nine prisoner Myuran Sukumaran\u00a0they hold out desperate hope that a last ditch legal appeal will bring them mercy. The family members were driven in a motorcade from the airport in Cilacap before climbing aboard a small boat, assisted by embassy officials, to visit the Nusakambangan prison island.

The Age reports Chinthu told reporters: 'My mum, sister and I have been waiting and counting down the days. We have been told he is doing well but we just want to see for ourselves, just make sure to go and see him, to let him know that we love him.' Michael said: 'Mum is fairly excited to see Andy today and it's been a few days, you know. We are looking forward to seeing him when we get over there.'

'People get second chances within their lives on the outside, but how much can you get when you\u2019re a convicted criminal.'

The relegation-threatened Barclays Premier League club stayed in the luxury five-star Meydan Hotel as they took advantage of a weekend off due to Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Capital One Cup final by travelling to the United Arab Emirates for a five-day break. Ramsey set ground rules ahead of the training camp at the plush Nad Al Sheba Sports Complex but allowed his players time off to visit Dubai\u2019s Meydan Racecourse to wind down.

No rocket science. The players knew what they were out there for. One of the things we wanted to avoid was people thinking that this was a reward for something. It\u2019s not a reward. It\u2019s not a holiday. It\u2019s a training camp. \u2018If we could have had the training camp down the road it would have been more convenient.

        "input": "Arsenal, for a change, performed with a trace of discipline. They played with poise. For once, Arsene Wenger\u2019s team refused to be lured into the high-speed pursuit of glory. They went about it all in a sensible manner. That has not always been the case. Perhaps lessons had been learned from the Charge of the Lightweight Brigade three weeks earlier. Fifteen consecutive years of Champions League knockout football and still learning important lessons. Talk about slow on the uptake. Such qualities should be ingrained in the club\u2019s fabric by this point. Arsene Wenger looks on as his side win in Monaco - but it was not quite enough to progress to the last eight . Olivier Giroud gave the Gunners hope, finishing with aplomb to increase the nerves among the home side . Aaron Ramsey stepped off the bench to latch on to a loose ball in the box to level the tie on aggregate . After the debacle at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg, they learned not to repeat their mistakes but it did them no good. Wenger\u2019s team kept a clean sheet and scored twice against a defence which had conceded only once in its previous 12 home games, but it was meaningless. Instead, here was another spectacular near-miss to file away in the collection. There was Robin van Persie\u2019s red card and Nicklas Bendtner\u2019s late chance in Barcelona and that 2-0 win in Munich against Bayern, a carbon copy of this tie, two years ago. There were the Lionel Messi four goals in 2010 when Pep Guardiola\u2019s Barca were at their peak, the penalty conceded by Kolo Toure at Liverpool and a near-miss against AC Milan, when Wenger raged at the referee, having lost by four in the San Siro. Again, there were what-ifs. What if Alexis Sanchez had been awarded a penalty instead of booked for diving? What if Danny Welbeck\u2019s shot had not hit Aymen Abdennour and deflected wide before half-time? What if Danijel Subasic had not clawed that one out of the top corner in the dying minutes? What if Arsenal learned how to cope with two-legged knockout ties against quality opposition? For a team who aspire to win major trophies, they have failed to make it past this stage for five successive years. They have not won a first knockout round tie since beating Porto in 2010. In this sense they have slipped backwards and next season they are likely to lose their privileged status as top seeds. They are not alone. In this last-16 round, it is France 2 England 0. Laurent Koscielny clatted the bar from close range in the first half as Arsenal showed their intent . The Edge, Larry Mullen Jnr and Bono were among the attendees at the Stade Louis II . Sure Monaco wobbled, seemingly petrified by the proximity to such a huge result, but they did just enough to dispel the myth that it takes time to adjust to this competition. The French club are in it for the first time in nine years, having lost key players last summer, and still Leonardo Jardim has forged an effective unit from a few old-timers and some promising youngsters. They seized on Arsenal\u2019s frailties in London and clung to their lead. Little wonder they erupted in triumph at the final whistle. History would not be rewritten. In the Champions League era, no team has recovered from losing at home in the first leg by two or more goals. There would be no Miracle in Monaco, under the terracotta tiles of Stade Louis II, where Irish rock band U2 came to watch on St Patrick\u2019s Day, and might have played Arsenal out with a chorus of Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For. Wenger\u2019s selection was typically bold \u2014 four at the back, shielded by Francis Coquelin, who was later discarded for Aaron Ramsey. There was no shortage of attacking options, but it would take a night of clinical finishing to get out of this corner. An early goal might have exerted more pressure on a team in unfamiliar territory and made them anxious, but 35 minutes had elapsed when Olivier Giroud struck. To score before the interval was important. Arsenal at last had exposed Monaco\u2019s nerve ends and the Monegasques shifted uneasily. Giroud perhaps epitomises the Arsenal riddle better than anyone. His goals have fuelled an upturn in form since the turn of the year. VIDEO Arsenal paid price for first leg - Wenger . Alexis Sanchez reacts after missing a chance on an ultimately frustrating night for the visitors . The Monaco bench erupts after the full-time whistle after the elimination of Wenger's side . He showed mental strength to overcome the disappointment of missed sitters in the first leg but chances went astray again: a header nodded wide early in the game and another into the goalkeeper\u2019s hands. By the end, he was getting in a muddle with Sanchez as the impossible briefly promised to materialise. Mesut Ozil went close, but not close enough, and the German did not manage to provide an image to eclipse the one of him swapping shirts with Geoffrey Kondogbia on his way off the pitch at half-time. Half-time shirt swaps do not go down well, especially during a defeat. Just ask Andre Santos. Theo Walcott shook the woodwork and substitute Ramsey levelled the tie at 3-3 but this was the stage they reached two years ago, against Bayern Munich. Still more was required. Time ran out on Arsenal. Time runs out on Wenger\u2019s dream of ever winning the Champions League.\n",

Wenger\u2019s players proved they have more maturity than in evidence during the pathetic first-leg . Olivier Giroud, too, proved that night of missed opportunities was something of an aberration amid a hot streak of form .\n"

        "input": "Years into the future, if historians look back at our convenience-obsessed era and pick one single product to sum up all of its follies, they will surely choose the disposable wet wipe. These moistened towelettes promise so much. They save us the apparent drudgery of having to dampen traditional cloths (that need washing when we\u2019ve finished with them) or having to remove make-up with face wash and a flannel. For parents, they also offer an easy solution to the mess babies make of themselves. But it now seems that our lazy ways have come at great environmental cost. Yesterday, a report by the Marine Conservation Society revealed that wet wipes have become the fastest growing cause of pollution on our beaches. Its volunteers are picking them up from our coastline at a rate of 35 filthy wipes per kilometre. Wet wipes have grown in popularity - from kitchen and toilet wipes to moistened towelettes for keyboards . Meanwhile they are clogging up our sewers, creating floods of noxious waste, and also triggering outbreaks of serious allergies. Over the past few years, our love affair with wet wipes has grown. If there\u2019s a part of our body or house that might harbour dirt, we\u2019ll happily buy a wipe marketed specifically to sweep it away at the flick of a wrist. Kitchen wipes, toilet wipes, face wipes, hand wipes, keyboard wipes, antibacterial wipes, baby wipes . . . With babycare, the cocktail of chemicals scarcely have a chance to dry on our little ones\u2019 skin before we slather them with another one. In the UK, we use on average between 1,500 and 2,250 baby wipes per child, from the day they are born until they reach three, according to the market analysts Euromonitor. That\u2019s far more than any other country in Europe. Our obsession doesn\u2019t stop with keeping our babies clean. We spend more than \u00a3500 million a year on wipes of all kinds, be they budget kitchen-cleaning ones that crowd pound-store shelves, or deluxe products such as l\u2019Occitane en Provence\u2019s citrus-scented \u2018refreshing towelettes\u2019 costing \u00a37 a pack \u2014 that\u2019s 50p a wipe. Our spending on these products is forecast to continue leaping by \u00a310 million every year. Once used, they are all too often casually tossed down the loo \u2014 with disastrous consequences. Huggies pure wipes may contain the chemical Methylparaben, which according to some researchers may cause skin toxicity . Last year, a sewer pipe under Shepherd\u2019s Bush, West London, became jammed by a blockage of fat and rubbish, known as a \u2018fatberg\u2019, that was the length of a Boeing 747. Thames Water said wet wipes were a major cause \u2014 because of the way they clog together with fat, grease and oil . The blockage caused raw sewage to flood into nearby homes, up through the toilets and sinks. It took Thames Water workers four very unpleasant days to clear. Three years ago, a similar blockage caused a tsunami of sewage to pour into the Menai Strait near Anglesey and this year Southern Water said more than 2,000 tons of wet wipes were playing havoc with sewers in Kent. The problem is that the wipes are not simply a dampened form of paper towel. They are usually made from a combination of plastics, wood pulp and cotton. The material is hard to break down and can float about our sewers and seas for years. Buying supposedly \u2018flushable\u2019 wet wipes make no difference, says Thames Water. Marine Conservation Society volunteers are picking wet wipes up from our coastline at a rate of 35 filthy wipes per kilometre . The sensible answer may seem simply to throw used ones into the bin. But even in landfill they create problems, due to the combination of alcohol, preservatives, fragrances, cleaning and moisturising agents with which they are impregnated. The antibacterial alcohol also kills the bacteria and enzymes which we rely on to break down solid waste in landfill sites \u2014 and in septic tanks, too. Don\u2019t think that composting them is a good idea, either. The synthetic fibres won\u2019t break down, while the chemicals and preservatives will pollute your plants and kill off the soil\u2019s ecology. But it is the effects on humans that should worry us most. A number of scientific papers have linked chemicals in wet wipes with serious outbreaks of skin allergy problems, most notably dermatitis and eczema. Numerous cases of skin rashes have been reported, most often on babies\u2019 skin and also on their parents\u2019 hands. One of the key culprits is a preservative chemical \u2014 the substance methylisothiazolinone (or MI, for short). A sewer pipe under Shepherd\u2019s Bush, West London, became jammed by a blockage of fat and rubbish, known as a \u2018fatberg\u2019 (pictured), last year . Researchers at the Leeds Centre for Dermatology and the St John\u2019s Institute of Dermatology at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London say this chemical is to blame for an increasing number of allergic reactions. Indeed, two years ago, the American Contact Dermatitis Society identified the chemical as the \u2018Allergen of the Year\u2019. The British Association of Dermatologists dedicated its annual conference to discussing MI in 2013, and persuaded the industry body, Cosmetics Europe, to tell its members to remove MI from any of their products that are left on the skin. This ban would include wet wipes, the British Association of Dermatologists assumed. But when, last July, the European Commission issued its own directive banning MI from products that stay on the skin, it appears to have omitted wet wipes. What is certain is that wet wipes containing the chemical are still readily available. Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s own-brand antibacterial wipes both feature MI, according to their websites. As for other brands, it is hard to tell, as research by Belgian experts showed that MI is not necessarily included on wet wipes\u2019 labels. And once anyone becomes sensitised to MI, by skin contact with wet wipes, they can suffer allergic reactions \u2014 such as widespread skin rashes or outbreaks of eczema \u2014 simply by sniffing the chemical from numerous sources such as the fumes from paint, according to a report by Danish investigators. Researchers have linked chemicals in wet wipes with serious outbreaks of skin allergy problems, most notably dermatitis and eczema (a little girl's eczema on her legs) Meanwhile, a host of other chemicals found in popular brands of wet wipes, such as polyhexamethylene biguanide, are also suspected as the cause of serious allergies. In addition, there is growing research that links over-use of antibacterial wet wipes with allergic conditions such as asthma. This could be linked to the \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019 \u2014 the theory that over-clean modern homes deny youngsters the mild exposure to bugs that their immune systems need for them to develop healthy responses to bacteria, rather then overreacting to harmless things such as household dust. In the meantime, Thames Water offers an alternative \u2014 Freshu, a foaming gel designed to be applied to standard loo paper, as a DIY sewer-friendly wet wipe. But perhaps the best answer is to jettison our convenience-driven neuroses about everyday dirt and germs. As study after study has shown, the safest and most effective answer to dangerous dirt is simple soap and water.\n",

But the singer has now hit back at her critics and vowed to resist the pressure to slim down. Speaking to Fabulous\u00a0magazine, the 28-year-old former X Factor star confessed that recent comments aimed at her weight, and questions about when she'll 'drop the post-baby pounds', have left her more determined than ever to stand up for herself. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Ferguson gave birth to gorgeous baby Arabella just four months ago, but has faced constant questions, even from those close to her, about how and when she'll lose her 'baby weight' The singer says even though she's only a size 12 following her third pregnancy, there has been a lot of pressure on her as a celebrity mum to 'snap back into shape' within a few weeks (Left: Rebecca during her third trimester and right: Rebecca in a bikini last month . She said 'There's this culture where we celebrate people snapping back into shape a week after the birth, but I don't want to be one of those people - I just want to enjoy Arabella.' Rebecca, who has never named the father of Arabella publicly, also has two other children called Lillie, aged 10, and Karl, nine, with her former boyfriend and teenage sweetheart Karl Dures, 29. And the singer now admits that she regrets not having had this empowering new mindset after she had her other kids. Describing how she felt as a new mum in previous years, the Get Happy singer said,\u00a0'When I look back, I think I should have just enjoyed my babies and not worried about my weight or being skinny. 'I'm curvy, I've got thighs, but I'm not big. I eat healthily and I'm breastfeeding, so I know the weight will come off naturally.' Rebecca pictured with her two older children Lillie 10, (left) and Karl, nine, (right) Currently promoting her new album Lady Sings The Blues, it would be easy for Rebecca to feel the need to slim down for upcoming photo shoots and interviews. But while some celebrities are famed for getting their impossibly taut figures back just weeks after giving birth, Rebecca says she's not feeling that pressure this time around. Instead, she's standing up for new mums everywhere, by taking aim at the critics who try to publicly shame women into losing weight. The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined (Pictured left: In concert at the St James Theatre, London, last month, and right: on This Morning last week) She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions. 'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined. 'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible (Rebecca pictured with her newborn) Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella. She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum. The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being. Rebecca flaunted her new curves on the red carpet at the Brit Awards last month and says she's proud of her womanly shape .\n",

        "input": "He is the latest object of female lust from Caithness to Cornwall \u2014 a heartbroken hero who is all brooding desire and smouldering good looks. And Aidan Turner, the new Ross Poldark, certainly has plenty of tumultuous romantic experiences to draw on. Perhaps, given his good looks, a rather swashbuckling love life is to be expected: gossips in Dublin insist that he was once \u2014 when between serious girlfriends \u2014 seen leaving a nightclub in the city with no fewer than three attentive females in tow. Scroll down for video . Aidan Turner is seen here with girlfriend of three years, Sarah Greene, who is also an actress and starred in Adam Jones with Bradley Cooper last year . He has had four serious romances to date, breaking the heart of one gorgeous actress and being thrown over by another. His first girlfriend was actress India Whisker, a pretty blonde whom he met in 2004 while at drama school in Dublin. She was followed by another actress, brunette Charlene McKenna. They lived together in Camden, North London, from 2007 to 2009. She told an interviewer how happy they were together. But within a few weeks they split, and she was apparently devastated. Turner then fell for Lenora Crichlow, his co-star in the TV series Being Human \u2014 from 2009 he played a vampire and she a ghost. Then in 2011, he and Lenora parted ways and he decided to quit the series while she stayed on. It seems that this was a source of great heartbreak for him. He said this week: \u2018I don\u2019t know anyone on this planet who hasn\u2019t had their heart broken. It\u2019s happened to me. Love is love, it\u2019s the purest and rawest thing we have in life.\u2019 Aidan Turner was also romantically involved with Charlene McKenna (pictured). They shared a flat together in Camden, North London from 2007 to 2009 . The following year he started to date the Irish actress Sarah Greene. She was nominated for a Tony award for her performance on Broadway opposite Daniel Radcliffe in The Cripple of Inishmaan, and last year starred in the film Adam Jones with Bradley Cooper. Their romance is still going strong after three years, but Turner admits that they are often separated by work. He spent 18 months making The Hobbit films in New Zealand early on in their liaison. He explained of the periods of separation: \u2018It\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever known [as a couple] and it makes for good times when we meet up again and maybe have a month straight when we\u2019re both unemployed and watching movies every day. It\u2019s fun to laze around and do normal things.\u2019 Aidan Turner (left) also dated\u00a0Lenora Crichlow (right) from 2009 to 2011, after they met on the TV series Being Human. He later decided to quit the series while she stayed on . Aidan is quietly bowled over by his sudden fame. Asked how it feels to be an overnight sex symbol, he chuckles. \u2018Ah, I wouldn\u2019t say that,\u2019 he demurred yesterday. \u2018Not at all. But it is nice that the show has gone down quite well and people are positive about it.\u2019 Understatement must be as much a part of his make-up as the kind of looks which have reduced the female half of the country to jelly. In the show, Turner is British Army officer Ross Poldark, who returns to Cornwall following the American War of Independence to find his father dead, the family\u2019s tin mine in ruins and his sweetheart, Elizabeth, engaged to his cousin. Aidan Turner (left) is seen with ex-girlfriend\u00a0actress India Whisker (right)\u00a0whom he met in 2004 while at drama school in Dublin . Since the opening episode on Sunday, there has been praise for the ensemble acting and the script \u2014 but mostly for how dishy the lead looks in a pair of britches. Even his mother, Eileen, is being stopped in the street and asked how it feels to have a sex-symbol son. \u2018That is very funny,\u2019 Aidan told me this week. \u2018I\u2019ve definitely never had that before. I can\u2019t believe it, really.\u2019 I can reveal that Turner is contracted to be in a further five series of Poldark, should the BBC make the obvious decision to make more. In the meantime, he is staying with his mum in South Dublin, although he is hoping to go away on holiday soon with girlfriend Sarah. Aidan Turner (pictured as Ross Poldark) has been bowled over by his sudden rise to fame and definitely doesn't consider himself a sex symbol . One of those watching Poldark on Sunday was his old drama teacher Patrick Sutton, director of Dublin\u2019s Gaiety School of Acting, who told me: \u2018I settled down in front of the telly like a child waiting to meet Father Christmas. And then he comes on, all brooding and bubbling and seething, and I said to myself: \u201cWell, that\u2019s a grand day out.\u201d I could not be prouder of him.\u2019 Mr Sutton, who counts Hollywood star Colin Farrell among his previous students, puts Aidan\u2019s success down to talent, hard work and good manners \u2014 all three of which Gaiety School students are taught. The son of Eileen, an accountant at a local carpet store, and Pat, an electrician, there is no acting background in Aidan\u2019s family \u2014 he hadn\u2019t even been to a play before he went to drama college. He was raised in Clondalkin, just west of Dublin, and went to St MacDara\u2019s Community College in Templeogue. One of two brothers, he recalls having been a bit of a tearaway as a schoolboy. He told one interviewer: \u2018I remember my mum getting called up a lot.\u2019 Smouldering: Aiden Turner with co-star Eleanor Tomlinson in Poldark . Dumped: In the BBC series, Poldark (Turner) is dumped by his former love Elizabeth (Heida Reed) His great talent at that age was ballroom dancing, and he even represented his country. He travelled around Ireland and internationally, competing in ballroom and Latin for around ten years. Tommy Shaughnessy, president of DanceSport Federation of Ireland, told me: \u2018I used to teach Aidan. He danced for years. But after I told his mother the cost of making it in international ballroom dancing, she said they couldn\u2019t afford it and told me that he might go into acting. \u2018This surprised me as he was very shy. Anyway, he joined the Gaiety School and the rest is history.\u2019 While at drama school, he did put his old skills to use, doing a dance for a fundraiser with his then girlfriend India Whisker. Turner had no idea what he wanted to do after school. After a stint working with his dad as an apprentice, he toyed with the idea of becoming a professional snooker player before spotted an advert for the Gaiety School of Acting. \u2018I didn\u2019t know anything about this world at all,\u2019 said Aidan. \u2018I felt intimidated from the get-go, but thought: \u201cThat\u2019s just right for me.\u201d The sense of potential failure is a buzz. \u2018Being around committed people there was very inspiring.\u2019 Before he started acting, Turner (pictured with Eleanor Tomlinson in Poldark), represented Ireland in ballroom dancing competitions across the country and internationally . He graduated in 2004, and had various theatre roles before getting a break in an Irish television medical drama, The Clinic, in 2008. The following year came Being Human. This attracted an excitable group of young fans whom he calls \u2018the posse\u2019, and who have followed his every move ever since. He gained more fans playing Kili, a heartthrob of the dwarf world in Peter Jackson\u2019s Hobbit films. But his biggest break was Poldark. Earlier this year he said: \u2018The offer came in and I said: \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s Poldark?\u201d I had to Google it. \u2018Then I called my mum. She said: \u201cYou\u2019d better not mess this up!\u201d \u2019 Don't mess this up! Turner hadn't heard of Poldark but was warned not to mess the job up by his mother . Perhaps we can forgive his ignorance as, since he\u2019s still only 31, he wasn\u2019t even born when the original Seventies TV version aired. One wonders if either he or girlfriend Sarah are ready for the attention which has just exploded, even more of which will no doubt follow with the promise of a buff and shirtless Poldark in future episodes. Sarah said in an interview last year that she had been outraged when some fans took pictures of him when he was asleep on the London Underground. But he says of the ardent kerfuffle: \u2018I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be bothered, no. We\u2019re both actors, we understand that it is part of our job.\u2019 In Aidan\u2019s case, the \u2018job\u2019 seems to be the play the role of newly minted national sex symbol \u2014 and he\u2019s doing it to perfection.\n",

Van Gaal refused to write off Liverpool's chances of finishing in the top-four but could not under-estimate the value of a 2-1 victory after Juan Mata struck twice. It was Liverpool's first Premier League defeat in 13 games since they lost 3-0 at Old Trafford in December. 'We beat Liverpool again,' said Van Gaal. 'They were in fantastic shape and we beat them with the old weapons \u2013 with the pressure on the ball in the first half. David de Gea uploaded a dressing room photograph of Manchester United's post-match celebrations . Juan Mata scored twice to secure three important points for the Red Devils away at Anfield . 'Now we are five points ahead of Liverpool, and six ahead of Tottenham and Southampton. To win in this moment is very important \u2013 one of the most important moments in my career. 'But there are still eight matches to go. That's 24 points. Liverpool can still be champions. When you are a top manager, or player or club \u2013 and Liverpool are \u2013 you have to deal with defeats. 'We have also dealt with defeats. We lost at home to Arsenal and then we had to play against Tottenham and Liverpool, and you have to manage that. Liverpool can do that also because they have a great manager, great club, great fans.' Van Gaal claimed that United had 'played Liverpool off the pitch' in a one-sided first half, but struggled after Steven Gerrard was sent of seconds after coming off the bench. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney (second right) is congratulated by Louis van Gaal at full time . Van Gaal (centre) hailed his side's performance as they moved five points clear of Liverpool in the league . He added: 'It was the best first 45 minutes because in the second half we were not so good and that's a little bit amazing because we played 11 against 10. It should be easier than the first half but it was not. 'I know in a sense that Liverpool should press us and they did but we played them off the pitch in the first half and scored a fantastic goal and gave nothing away. 'I came in the dressing-room and gave all my compliments because I was so happy, but then in the second half everything changed because of the red card. Then we weren't playing like a team anymore. We were running with the ball and losing it unnecessarily. When we didn't have the ball we didn't press the opponent. That was different in the first half. 'Nevertheless, we didn't give many chances away. David de Gea has saved us a lot of times this season but I couldn't remember one save in this match.' Mata, scorer of both United goals, was happy with his performance after the game, and admitted that the last few months have been difficult. Mamadou Sakho (centre) also posted a picture to Twitter, alongside the caption: 'I'm obviously disappointed to have lost today but we gave our best especially in the second half' Steven Gerrard was sent off soon after coming on, but Van Gaal says it was harder to play against 10 men . 'I think it's my best game in a United shirt, yes. It's a massive game, probably the biggest in English football, so to score two goals is great for me,' Mata told Sky Sports. 'The second goal has to be up there with my best. After Steven Gerrard was sent off we needed a second goal because they pushed us to the end. 'It was important for me. The last few months I've not had the best moment. It is the manager who decides but I'm happy today.' Van Gaal was sufficiently impressed, but like Mourinho at Chelsea who preferred Oscar, Willian and Eden Hazard in the three creative positions behind the lone striker, said Mata did not always fit into his formation. 'Now he is playing as a false right winger and the communication with (Ander) Herrera and (Antonio) Valencia gives him more opportunities,' Van Gaal told reporters. 'I think he was one of my most consistent players. I am not amazed, but I am very happy for him.' Mata's second goal of the afternoon was a stunning bicycle kick to put United 2-0 up at Anfield . Brendan Rodgers struck on a new 4-3-3 formation when Liverpool lost at United, and Van Gaal revealed that he had given his players the option to change from 4-3-3 and revert to a three-man defence as well. He said: 'Liverpool changed their system against us in the home match and then we played with three defenders at that time. We won 3-0. The coach continued with this system and they have won everything. They never lost. And then we came again. We stayed with the system that we've had the last four or five weeks. 'We had to prove it against the system we usually play. I asked the players that we can play with three defenders or shall we continue with 4-3-3? But then you have to play like a team, and that I have seen in the first half. That was marvellous to see.'\n",

At $10,000, the 18-carat gold, sapphire and crystal Apple Watch Edition being launched on Monday would be the firm's most expensive product since the $10,000 Lisa computer in 1983, developed by Steve Jobs, which was poorly received. It is the first new innovation to come from Apple since Jobs died in 2011, and will be unveiled by chief executive Tim Cook on Monday. Analysts have branded the move a clear attempt to segway into Asia's booming luxury goods market - and suggest it could be the start of an entirely new market. Scroll down for video . Luxury: The Apple Watch Edition is 18-carat gold, sapphire and crystal, priced at a reported $10,000 . 'Elegant curve': A luxury goods analyst for Sotheby's said the design looks promising as a high-end product . Launch: Tim Cook will unveil the new Apple Watch Edition, plus two others, on Monday . 'Apple is the only technology brand that has the potential to move from tech brand to luxury brand. This is unprecedented,' Jan Dawson, chief technology analyst for Jackdaw Research, told DailyMail.com. 'I think this is Apple flexing its muscles, moving into a space that it potentially has all to itself. 'The question is: how big is that market? Is Apple eating into the market or making it bigger? 'I think they will make it grow.' Cook is expected to explain in detail how customers will use the buttons on the side of the device to operate the apps on the screen like an iPhone. At the other end of the spectrum, customers can opt for a midrange watch or an 'entry-level' Watch Sport, starting at $349 - a fraction of most watch prices on the market. Tag Heuer's Monaco Men's Watch will set shoppers back $72,000. The Rolex GMT-Master II Mens Automatic Watch costs an eye-watering $373,720. The move into this market comes months after Apple poached Burberry's CEO Angela Ahrendts to be the new Senior Vice President of retail and sales - and lend a fashionable eye. Alongside Yves Saint Laurent's Paul Deneve, as a 'special projects' Vice President, and designer Marc Newson, as a part-time consultant, the team has masterminded the firm's unprecedented move. Big move: The products will be the first new innovations to come from Apple since Steve Jobs died in 2011 . Wearables: Analysts say the shift into wearables will be a major breakthrough for the firm targeting China . In October, a prototype of the Edition Watch even appeared at Paris Fashion Week. However, some have speculated that without a solid grounding in the high-end retail market, the Apple Edition Watch could suffer the same flaws as most iPhones, which cease to efficiently function after a few years. But according to Thoma\u00ef Serdari, Luxury Brand Strategist and Lecturer at Sotheby\u2019s Institute of Art in New York, the details of the Edition model that have been released look promising. She told DailyMail.com: 'Apple produces good design, and I hate to say it but good design is priceless. 'From what I have seen, the gold watch has a very elegant profile. The very slight curve shows that the design has been very well studied to fit on your wrist. I am curious to see how it actually feels. 'I wouldn't be surprised if customers have the option of keeping the strap and the casing but updating the software, which would create loyalty and longevity.' Serdari, who also lectures on product and fashion design at NYU, notes that Apple is following the classic launch strategy of designer brands like Chanel, which uses pricing to carve a position in the market.

'In my opinion, Apple is very well positioned to make the transition to move up.' If successful, the Edition Watch could act as a springboard for Apple to rocket into its bulls-eye: China. Tim Cook has repeatedly remarked that he predicts China to eventually overtake America as their biggest market. The popularity of the iPhone 6 drove the firm's market share in China to a record high, reaching 25.4 per cent by January 2015 - clouding out Samsung as the country's second-largest seller. However, Xiaomi - widely dubbed 'the Apple of China' - remains firm with 27.6 per cent of the market. Venturing into watches and potentially other wearables, with Ahrendts at the helm, could be the leap that clinches it. Dawson said: 'They could really move into anything - necklaces, bracelets, brooches... It's not clear how those might feature a screen to function in the way that a watch does. But Apple is certainly in a position to try.'\n",

Cook was devastated to be axed from 50-over cricket on the brink of his first World Cup and has watched as England have struggled to improve without him under new captain Eoin Morgan. Yet Moores says his relationship with Cook is undamaged and they have been busy planning for their imminent three-Test series against the West Indies. England coach Peter Moores talks with Alex Hales during an England nets session in Adelaide on Saturday . 'I've spoken to Alastair quite a bit and he's in a good place,' said the England coach ahead of the do or die World Cup match against Bangladesh. 'He's outside of this and is able to plan for Test cricket. 'Our working relationship hasn't changed. He's been an international for a long time and he realises it's a tough business and things change. He's thrown his focus totally into the big Test cricket to come.' That Caribbean series follows this World Cup and begins a year of Test cricket that includes a home series against New Zealand and another Ashes before visits to the UAE to face Pakistan and then South Africa. Alastair Cook (left) was devastated to be axed from 50-over cricket on the brink of his first World Cup . Moores admitted that national selector James Whitaker has spoken to Jonathan Trott about a possible return to the Test side. England may face a West Indies side without Chris Gayle \u2014 expected to retire from international cricket after this World Cup \u2014 and many of their best players could take part in the Indian Premier League instead. England will therefore consider resting players because they have so much important cricket ahead of them, not least the establishing of what will have to be a new one-day side. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad \u2014 prime candidates to be protected from burn-out \u2014 will both resist any attempts to force them to rest. National selector James Whitaker has spoken to Jonathan Trott (above) about a possible return to Test cricket . Anderson is four wickets away from overtaking Sir Ian Botham as England's leading Test wicket-taker and wants his family to join him for the first Test in Antigua in the hope he will reach the landmark there. Meanwhile, Moores on Sunday insisted he had no regrets about returning as England coach despite the huge pressure which comes with a poor showing at the World Cup. 'No regrets at all,' said Moores. 'I felt I could make a difference. We know we've been behind in the one-day format and have to get better.'

The world No 1 will arrive at Augusta National hunting the elusive Green Jacket he needs to complete a historic Grand Slam of majors. Only five players have achieved the incredible feat, post-war. But victory at the Masters will elevate the Northern Irishman into the company of legends Gene Sarazen, Gary Player, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. Rory McIlroy hits the gym as he prepares for the Masters at Augusta next month . The Northern Irishman has been pumping iron as he goes hunting for the elusive Green Jacket . McIlroy shows off the US Open trophy to fans back in Northern Ireland four years ago . At times, McIlroy has made it look easy. For the past 73 weeks he has been the leading golfer on the planet, landing The Open and the US PGA Championship along the way. Although the 25-year-old still has a long way to go before surpassing Woods' record of 683 total weeks as world No 1, he is undoubtedly the American's successor as golf's heavyweight star - both on and off the greens. And his obsession with the gym is giving the star more than a helping hand. 'It was when I started to notice results that I fell in love with it,' said McIlroy, who has offered a fascinating and unique insight into his preparation off the course in this new Nike training video, seen exclusively by Sportsmail. Indeed, McIlroy has bulked up considerably over the past five years with his transformation evident in both stature and presence on the course. Since 2010 he has worked closely with Dr Steve McGregor, a British exercise physiologist who has previously masterminded the fitness programmes for Manchester City and the NBA's New York Knicks. When McIlroy first started with McGregor he could barely stand 10 seconds balancing on one leg. Now, with 14 wins and four majors to his name, he has the muscle strength to last on one leg throughout an entire golf swing. McIlroy is setting out on his quest to join the pantheon of golf's greatest-ever players . The 25-year-old needs a Masters crown to complete a historic Grand Slam of golfing majors . McIlroy won the 143rd Open Championship at Royal Liverpool in Hoylake in July last year . 'I wasn't really big into the gym,' he admits. 'So my physical training was pretty much non-existent from when I turned pro at 18 until I turned 21. 'I had three years when I was playing professionally on the Tour, doing OK but not, I guess, maximising my potential by coming into the gym and doing the work that I needed to do. 'I ended up having a few niggles here and there \u2013 a few little injuries which, had I let them go on longer, could have turned into serious issues that could have put me out for a while. 'So it was definitely out of necessity that I started \u2013 for injury prevention more than anything else. Then the more you get into, you find yourself wanting to get stronger. You want to see what your limits are and to test your body physically. I really started to get into it and it became part of my lifestyle. Up to that point it hadn't been \u2013 I'd just played golf without really training much or watching what I ate. Now, obviously, things are very different. McIlroy won by one stroke to clinch the 96th PGA Championship at Valhalla in August last year . 'It took me four years of training to get my body into the best possible shape for what I do, which ultimately is go out and play golf. I have no ambitions to try and squat 500 pounds like some guys do but I do enough and I'm strong enough to control the golf club the whole way through my swing \u2013 that's basically what I need to do. 'For some people [going to the gym] it's just looking in the mirror and feeling better about themselves, or tracking their numbers \u2013 lifting bigger, lifting heavier, being able to do more reps with more weight or whatever it is. 'But for me it was being able to stand up, hit 50 drivers in a row and feel no pain in my back. That is what made me realise that training is something I need to do \u2013 I need to do this a lot, and if I want to prolong my career as much as I can, I need to keep doing it.' Since 2010 he has worked closely with Dr Steve McGregor, who masterminded Man City's fitness programme . McGregor devises programmes that stretch between six to eight weeks in order to get McIlroy in the best possible shape for major tournaments, with the focus on adding stability, strength and power. During tournament week, McGregor attempts to control McIlroy's desire to post a workout. The superstar will train, on top of his practice range sessions, nearly every day bar the tournament-ending Sunday. At last year's Open at Hoylake, McGregor made McIlroy a deal that he could do a gym session if he shot a round of 67. McIlroy carded a 66. 'I'll do my heavier sessions on Monday and Tuesday, maybe take a day off, and then do a couple of lighter ones over the course of the Thursday, Friday and Saturday,' said McIlroy. 'I'll always give myself Sunday off just as it's the last day of the tournament \u2013 maybe I'll go in if I feel like some sort of warm-up session, but nothing more. So two heavier sessions and two lighter sessions.' When McIlroy first started with McGregor he could barely stand 10 seconds balancing on one leg . McIlroy believes his preparation for Augusta has been perfect and the man who finished runner-up to Formula One king Lewis Hamilton at last year's BBC Sports Personality of the Year contest is confident that he stands a good chance of triumphing in Georgia. 'Obviously it's the first really big tournament of the year and it's even bigger for me this time round for a few different reasons,' he added. 'I think I've had a good build-up to it. 'We try to put a lot of work into it at the start of the year, around January and February time, going through different phases of training. Endurance at the start, and then more into a strength phase, before maybe tapering off a little bit in the lead up to the Masters. 'We still work hard the week before but then the week of the tournament we try to taper it down so that I know I'm in great shape and I know I'm ready. I'll have done the volume, I'll have done the workload and I'll just be ready to go out and play.' Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam... now is it time for McIlroy to become the next British champion of the Masters? Indeed, the nation hopes the hard work will ultimately pay off. A grand slam and golf folklore awaits if McIlroy can finally lift the big one. Visit Nike Training YouTube for the Inner Strength documentary series with Rory McIlroy.\n",

A former Coronation Street actor who struggled with his career and sexuality killed himself just hours after learning that his father had died, an inquest has heard. Trevor Smith, known by his stage name Trevor Hancock, was found drowned in a lagoon at a disused quarry near his home in Derbyshire on January 6 this year. One day earlier, the 42-year-old had been discharged from a week-long stay in hospital, after undergoing surgery for self-inflicted injuries. As he was being discharged, a nurse at the hospital also gave him the devastating news about his father's death. Just one hour later, a concerned friend had reported Mr Smith missing, a call which triggered a day-long manhunt for the actor. Officers found his mobile in his home, which contained pictures of the quarry where his body was discovered the following day. It later emerged that Mr Smith, who had also appeared in Emmerdale and Hollyoaks, had been overwhelmed by his career, stress and his sexuality in the months before his death and suffered from 'dark moods'. Mr Smith, who was born in Middleton, Greater Manchester, had been admitted to Sheffield's Northern General Hospital on December 30 after his friend phoned 999 over concerns for his welfare. The inquest heard how he had sent a input to a young student actor whom he 'had taken under his wing' saying: 'Sorry I have to go now. You're the only one who can do this.' The message to Tom Lewin also asked him to phone police, as well as the people he wanted to contact about his death. After Mr Lewin phoned the emergency services for help, police smashed down Mr Smith's door and found him unconscious in the bathroom. When they revived him, Mr Smith told officers he did not want to be saved. In hospital, the actor underwent surgery for his injury, before both of wrists were put in casts. He was also assessed by psychiatrists, who were happy for him to leave hospital, under the proviso he was monitored by the community mental health team. But later that morning, Mr Smith told his close friend Darren Langford, with whom he was staying, that he needed to take a jacket back to a friend. When he did not return for an hour, Mr Langford called the police. Mr Smith, who had been a professional actor since 1991,\u00a0appeared in Coronation Street (pictured) in 1999 as Kevin Dolan, a valuer from estate agents Adam Wade & C, who were selling the soap's shop, The Kabin . The inquest heard that, while in hospital, Mr Smith had disclosed 'problems with his career, stress and his sexuality'. The actor had been a professional actor since 1991, training at Manchester's Arden School of Theatre from 1996 to 1999. That year, he went on to appear in Coronation Street as Kevin Dolan, a valuer from estate agents Adam Wade & C, who were selling the soap's shop, The Kabin. Rita (left), played by actress Barbara Knox, spots the For Sale sign on the Kabin - while Mr Smith sold as part of his role on the show - while talking to Betty Turpin (right), played by the late Betty Driver . He later appeared in two episodes of Emmerdale playing a character called Tom. He also took on roles in Hollyoaks, ITV's The Memoirs of Sherlock Homes, and Channel 4 medical drama No Angels. Along with a number of short film credits, including Gate Crash, Behind Closed Doors he appeared in a feature film Salvage and various TV commercials. But his career had stalled in recent years and his sister Julie Smith said he had been depressed about his life. 'He loved acting and had small roles on TV and in the theatre,' she said in a statement. 'He believed he would become a great actor.' She said he had mentioned suicide in the past, but to her knowledge had never harmed himself. During the hearing in Chesterfield, Derbyshire's assistant coroner James Newman read a statement from Katherine Wells, a mental health nurse at the hospital, who had told Mr Smith his father had died. Summing up Mr Newman said: 'Whilst in hospital it would appear that Trevor Smith, to some extent, disclosed the reason why he had cut his wrists, it was, mainly related to his career, stress and his sexuality.' Returning a conclusion of suicide the coroner said: 'I'm satisfied with the evidence before me that Trevor Smith intended to take his own life, but furthermore he took steps to carry that out.' After his death, Coronation Street stars led the tributes to the late actor. Antony Cotton tweeted: 'Love life and live life because you just never know\u2026With great sadness, @Ecclestonshire and I have just raised a glass to our friend and colleague who died today. Rest in peace my friend.' While Kym Marsh said: 'Very sad news today. Still in shock. A huge loss for us all RIP to an amazing guy #so young.' Samia Ghadie also posted a quote which read: 'Be grateful for every second of every day that you get to spend with the people you love. Life is so precious.' Catherine Tyldesley, who plays Eva, retweeted her co-star's posts and also shared: 'Just awful. A true gentleman. So thoughtful, kind and gentle. RIP. Gods new angel [sic].'

Tom Cotton, appeared to try to goad Iran's leaders into forgoing a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute. Neither have they stopped since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered what was effectively a reelection campaign speech on the House floor. Despite so many concerted efforts to sabotage our diplomats, our negotiators are still hard at work to secure an agreement with Tehran that, if successfully concluded, will go down in the annals of diplomatic history as marking a new era for U.S.-Iran relations. Indeed, progress toward a political framework would move us closer to attainable safeguards on Iran's nuclear program as well as jump-start a more productive relationship that could pay extra dividends for years to come. Before President Obama's phone call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last fall -- the first direct contact between U.S. and Iranian heads of state in more than 30 years -- such an agreement seemed unthinkable. Now, with clear-eyed diplomacy, negotiators from the U.S. and five other countries, plus Iran, are in reach of delivering a peaceful resolution to the decade-long impasse over Iran's nuclear program. Diplomats have tackled thorny, complex nonproliferation issues that have never been comprehensively addressed in a multilateral agreement before. They have labored to eliminate Iran's potential pathways to a nuclear weapon while allowing the country to maintain a limited nuclear energy program, but under what is arguably the world's most locked-down nuclear inspections regime. U.S., German, British, French, Chinese and Russian negotiators are continuing to build on the solid success of the preliminary nuclear accord negotiated last year, the so-called Joint Plan of Action. That plan continues to grant inspectors daily access to Iran's nuclear facilities in order to verify its adherence to the agreement. As a result, Iran's nuclear program will be frozen for the first time since its inception, as diplomats craft a comprehensive resolution to this standoff. If and when a final agreement is reached, the President may temporarily waive some sanctions if Iran's compliance can be verified. Congress has, for its part, authorized the President to provide limited, temporary and reversible sanctions relief so long as doing so advances U.S. national security interests. As former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and countless other national security experts have attested, such a diplomatic solution to this crisis is squarely in the national interests of the United States. In exchange for Iran following through on its promises to constrain its program in accordance with the agreement, the U.S. Congress will be asked to lift sanctions permanently. If Tehran demonstrates its long-term commitment to limit its nuclear program to exclusively peaceful purposes, then when the time comes, Congress should be ready to lift the sanctions. In the interim, it is crucial that all parties scrupulously adhere to the terms of this landmark agreement. While Iran must not install unauthorized centrifuges, attempt a secret program or otherwise fail to adhere to the agreement, the U.S. Congress also has responsibilities under the agreement, including appropriations for its execution and refraining from imposing new sanctions in violation of either the letter or the spirit of the deal. All this suggests that to jeopardize such progress at this critical stage would be reckless, if not foolhardy. Of course, history suggests that we should be cautious. And the stakes are indeed extremely high. But the last thing the world needs is another major war in the Middle East. Members of Congress should therefore join the preeminent statesmen, military officers and the overwhelming majority of the American public in welcoming what is poised to be a diplomatic success -- one that could protect U.S. security and prevent further instability in the Middle East that would result from a nuclear Iran. We should ensure that our diplomats have the support they need to reach the finish line and that our President is able to cross it.\n",

Felicia Mulero, who lives in Kansas with her young son, knew her father Herminio Mulero, 50, was battling stage-five kidney disease in Florida. But instead of letting him wait for a kidney on the transplant list, the 24-year-old quietly underwent tests to see if she could be a viable match for his much-needed organ donation. 'It's so amazing to me that I can help save my dad; I can help save a life - and it's my dad's,' Felicia explained in a video on the\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0page her family created to raise money for the costs surrounding the surgery. Priceless gift: Felicia can be seen cuddling up with her father\u00a0Herminio Mulero. The 24-year-old secretly planned on giving him her kidney but waited to see if she was a match before sharing the life-saving news . Family ties: Felicia and Herminio shared a special moment on the beach. The 50-year-old dad has been battling stage-five kidney disease in Florida and was awaiting an organ donation on the transplant list . Herminio, who has been suffering from kidney problems for the past seven years, has been relying on daily dialysis to keep him alive as he awaits an organ donation. 'The waiting list could take months, years you really don\u2019t know they have to find a match,' he told Bay News 9. He had no idea that his daughter was secretly going through the process to give him her kidney. Herminio's wife Kathleen explained to the outlet that Felicia matches four markers when most children only match three out of six. The father-daughter duo are currently going through the final stages of testing to make sure that she can proceed with the organ donation. 'I\u2019m very thankful to have a beautiful daughter who has very compassionate heart,' Herminio said. While Felicia's selfless donation will most likely save her father's life, the family also has financial worries to consider. Say cheese: The father-daughter duo happily smiled for this family photo. The family is currently trying to raise $30,000 on their GoFundMe page to pay for the costs associated with the surgery . Close ties: Herminio and Felicia posed on a bench during one of their visits. She is determined to be the one to save her dad's life . Last month, the family created their GoFundMe page in hopes of raising $30,000 for the expenses not covered by Herminio's insurance, in addition to the cost of Felicia's travel and recovery. The page states that Herminio needs at least $8,000 worth of emergency medications before they will schedule the surgery. He will also require expensive medications after the procedure. Meanwhile, Felicia, who is also parent, will need money to travel, pay her bills and find childcare for her son while she recovers. Although the family has reached nearly $5,000, they are still far from their original goal. On the page, Felicia noted that she and her father have always been close, even after she moved to the Midwest when she was 13 years old. She added that the distance between them has been become especially difficult because of his illness. 'I cannot wait to get through the rest of these tests to know for sure that I can do this and I can save him and I won\u2019t be crushed because he\u2019s not going to get the transplant,' she said. 'I\u2019m going to be the one who\u2019s going to do it, and I\u2019m going all the way in - 100per cent, full force, it\u2019s going to happen.'\n",

        "input": "Roy Hodgson is confident in Harry Kane's ability to shine for England, it is just a case of whether there is space for him in the upcoming squad. This has been quite the season for the 21-year-old, whose 24 goals in all competitions is far and away the best tally from any English striker this term. That form has impressed Three Lions boss Hodgson, who has strongly hinted recently that Kane will earn a first senior call-up in two weeks' time. England manager Roy Hodgson is open to the possibility of calling up Tottenham striker Harry Kane . The Spurs front man has is a regular in the England Under 21 set up and has been in great form for his club . Kane was far from his best in the Capital One Cup final but Hodgson said he thinks the striker is 'ready' It is not just the Spurs man vying for a striking berth, though, with a number of other in-form, uncapped players hoping to be involved against Lithuania and Italy. Saido Berahino, Danny Ings and Charlie Austin have all impressed for their clubs this season - but it is Kane who is the main talking point. 'He's in my thoughts of course, he deserves to be,' Hodgson said, speaking at the London Football Awards, which raises funds for national charity, Willow. 'He's scoring goals for one of our top teams in the Premier League but I know him anyway, he's done a lot of good work for the Under-21s. Burnley striker Danny Ings (right) is among the names for a call up to the Three Lions first team . QPR's Charlie Austin (left) and West Brom's Saido Berahino (right) have both been in fine scoring form . 'What pleases me most is young players are getting their chance to play. In the past 19, 20, 21-year-olds would be loaned out or would have to sit back and wait for their chance. Now more and more of them are taking the chance when they get it. 'I'm delighted for him and we'll see when I select my squad at the end of month if he's in it.' Asked whether Kane was ready to make the step up to the senior side, Hodgson said: 'He's ready. If he wasn't ready he wouldn't be playing for Tottenham and scoring lots of goals. 'The question you ask is has the player got the quality and talent we're looking for and is there a space for him? 'If he comes in then someone's going to drop out and most forwards we've got have done quite well in the autumn. 'But I can't include everyone unfortunately. It's not always a question of are they good enough, it's a question of is there space at this time.' However Kane is the one gaining all the attention having scored 24 goals in all competitions this season . Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck look set to be involved in the squad, while Rickie Lambert and Jermain Defoe are other experienced forward options when the national team reconvene after a four-month break. 'I am looking forward to it, we all are,' Hodgson said. 'Certainly I and my coaching staff are. I hope the players are looking forward to it, too. 'It will be nice to see them again. We did plan a little meeting in January but we found another way of staying in touch with them. 'It will be nice to see them physically again and I hope to see them in as good a shape as I thought they were last autumn.'

        "input": "A Massachusetts teenager's confession to police that he killed his math teacher cannot be used in his murder trial, a judge ruled Tuesday even as he allowed a bloody box cutter and other key pieces of evidence to be admitted. The ruling came in the case of 16-year-old Philip Chism, who has pleaded not guilty to raping and killing 24-year-old Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer on school grounds in October 2013. Chism's lawyers had argued that police coerced their client, then 14, into making detailed statements about the killing, despite invoking his right to remain silent. Prosecutors maintained Chism and his mother had never absolutely demanded a lawyer. Scroll down for video . Confession not admissible: Philip Chism - seen here in a Massachusetts court in January - confessed to police that he killed his math teacher, however a judge has ruled it cannot be used in his murder trial . Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett, through a spokeswoman, said his office was still reviewing the decision. Calls to Chism's public defenders seeking comment were not immediately returned. Ritzer's family said in a statement it respected the court ruling and was confident that law enforcement 'acted responsibly and lawfully' in investigating their daughter's killing. The 48-page decision came after days of arguments and testimony on the defense's motion to suppress key pieces of evidence in the case. Salem Superior Court Judge David Lowy concluded that Chism had willingly talked to police in the town of Topsfield on the night of the killing, calmly answering questions and even correcting officers at various points. But Chism's demeanor changed when he was taken to the Danvers police station and further interrogated in his mother's presence, the judge noted. At that point, Lowy said, Chism grew uncomfortable and somewhat hostile. Murdered:\u00a0Colleen Ritzer was a popular and enthusiastic math teacher at Danvers High School. Phillip Chism has pleaded not guilty to her rape and murder . Charged: Philip D. Chism was indicted by an Essex County grand jury today on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated rape and armed robbery in 2013 . He twice indicated his disinterest in speaking with Danvers police and 'did not appear to be fully engaged' or to appreciate the seriousness of what officers asked him as they explained his Miranda rights, the judge wrote. 'It is clear that the defendant wanted to talk to the police without his mother present in the room,' Lowy said in his ruling. 'It is also clear that he had no intention of talking while his mother was in the room.' As a result, the judge said, he would allow the statements Chism made to Topsfield police to be introduced as evidence but not his taped confession at the Danvers police station. He also allowed items gathered at Danvers High School, as well as those seized from Chism's pockets and backpack. They included Ritzer's ID and credit cards, a bloody box cutter and women's underwear. In memoriam: The campus of Danvers High School was flooded with flowers and other tokens following the October 2013 murder of teacher Colleen Ritzer . R.I.P.:\u00a0Danvers High School community mourns the tragic death of beloved math teacher Colleen Ritzer whose body was found behind the school . But Lowy ruled prosecutors cannot use evidence from Chism's and Ritzer's cellphones, which were found near a movie complex. Authorities say surveillance video from October 22, 2013, shows Chism following Ritzer into a school bathroom, wearing gloves and a hood, then later walking out of the bathroom alone. A short time later, the video shows Chism pulling a recycling barrel through the school and outside. Ritzer's body was later found in nearby woods, naked from the waist down and with her throat slit and a note that read, 'I hate you all.' Authorities said she was sexually assaulted with a stick. A bloody recycling bin was found nearby. Dianna Chism (left) attends her son Philip Chism's hearing in Suffolk County Juvenile Court Wednesday, July 23, 2013, in Boston, where he was arraigned for allegedly assaulting a state worker while he was in custody at a Department of Youth Services facility . Chism, who had recently moved to Massachusetts from Clarksville, Tennessee, was found that night by Topsfield police walking along a nearby highway. Prosecutors allege that after the killing, Chism used Ritzer's credit card to buy fast food and attend a movie at the mall. Chism's trial is scheduled for October 7. Both sides are expected back in court for a pre-trial hearing on April 9.\n",

The say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted Mercury black over billions of years. It solves the mystery of Mercury's unusual colouring - which has baffled scientists. The say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted Mercury with a dark 'stealth' coating over billions of years. Cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight, so Mercury would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets. Using a model of impact delivery and a known estimate of micrometeorite flux at Mercury, researchers calculated suggest that after billions of years of bombardment, Mercury's surface should be anywhere from 3 to 6 percent carbon. 'It's long been hypothesized that there's a mystery darkening agent that's contributing to Mercury's low reflectance,' said Megan Bruck Syal, a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who performed this research while a graduate student at Brown University. 'One thing that hadn't been considered was that Mercury gets dumped on by a lot of material derived from comets.' On average, Mercury is much darker than its closest airless neighbour, our Moon. Airless bodies are known to be darkened by micrometeorite impacts and bombardment of solar wind, processes that create a thin coating of dark iron nanoparticles on the surface. But spectral data from Mercury suggests its surface contains very little nanophase iron, certainly not enough to account for its dim appearance. As comets approach Mercury's neighborhood near the sun, they often start to break apart. Cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight, so Mercury would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets. Using a model of impact delivery and a known estimate of micrometeorite flux at Mercury, Bruck Syal was able to estimate how often cometary material would impact Mercury, how much carbon would stick to Mercury's surface, and how much would be thrown back into space. Her calculations suggest that after billions of years of bombardment, Mercury's surface should be anywhere from 3 to 6 percent carbon. The next part of the work was to find out how much darkening could be expected from all that impacting carbon. For that, the researchers turned to the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range. The 14-foot canon simulates celestial impacts by firing projectiles at up to 16,000 miles per hour. Experiments show that impact material is significantly darkened when impacts occur in the presence of complex organics - shown here on the right . For this study, the team launched projectiles in the presence of sugar, a complex organic compound that mimics the organics in comet material. The heat of an impact burns the sugar up, releasing carbon. Projectiles were fired into a material that mimics lunar basalt, the rock that makes up the dark patches on the nearside of the Moon. 'We used the lunar basalt model because we wanted to start with something dark already and see if we could darken it further,' said Peter Schultz, professor emeritus of geological sciences at Brown and a co-author of the new research. The experiments showed that tiny carbon particles become deeply embedded in the impact melted material. The process reduced the amount of light reflected by the target material to less than 5 percent -- about the same as the darkest parts of Mercury. Importantly, spectroscopic analysis of the impact samples revealed no distinctive spectral fingerprints, again similar to flat spectral signatures from Mercury. 'We show that carbon acts like a stealth darkening agent,' Schultz said. 'From the standpoint of spectral analysis, it's like an invisible paint.' And that paint has been building up on Mercury's surface for billions of years. 'We think this is a scenario that needs to be considered,' Schultz said. 'It appears that Mercury may well be a painted planet.'\n",

The punishment is believed to be Iran's first case of Qasas, meaning retribution in kind, Tasnim News said.

The boy, who has not been named, was caught speeding down Strand at 5.30pm when he suddenly swerved into four lanes of oncoming traffic, weaving through cars as they tried to avoid him. Police say the dangerous stunt led to him being arrested, banned from the roads for 12 months, and being given a youth rehabilitation order and a curfew. Merseyside police said this 16-year-old is 'lucky to be alive' after he was caught driving his quadbike into four lanes of oncoming traffic in Liverpool city centre . The teenager (top centre) was\u00a0banned from the roads for 12 months and given a youth rehabilitation order and a curfew after the stunt which took place at the peak of the evening rush hour . Footage of the daylight crime was released by Merseyside Police during a crackdown on illegal and antisocial use of off-road bikes during which 28 bikes were seized during early morning raids. Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roy said: 'He is lucky to be alive and the case clearly highlights the risks for the entire community when off-road bikes are ridden in this way. 'Today's action is all about responding to the concerns of communities across Merseyside and targeting those people who we believe have been using scrambler bikes in a dangerous or anti-social way. 'We know that many people are plagued by the problem of off-road vehicles and actually find them incredibly intimidating. 'When they are ridden dangerously, they pose a huge risk, not only to the safety of the rider but also to pedestrians and other law-abiding road users. 'We know that there are still scramblers, quads and other vehicles out there which are being ridden dangerously or anti-socially, and I hope today shows that when we have information, we will act on it to tackle the problem.' The footage was released as part of a police crackdown against the illegal and antisocial use of off-road bikes in Liverpool, during which 28 bikes were seized . The teenager was captured on CCTV driving the correct way down Strand road moments before swerving into the opposite lane as car try to dodge around him . He added: 'I would appeal to people across Merseyside to carry on calling us if they know where nuisance bikes are being stored or they have information about the people who are using them.' Merseyside's Police Commissioner Jane Kennedy said: 'Residents, farmers and businesses have raised with me many times their concerns about the illegal and anti-social use of scrambler and quadbikes. 'These nuisance bikes can blight communities and present a real danger to members of the public. Sadly, we have recently seen the devastating consequences of using these bikes. 'I welcome this crackdown by Merseyside Police. It demonstrates their commitment to taking action, removing these vehicles from our roads and footpaths and tackling this problem.'\n",

        "input": "(CNN)The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is making headlines again. On Wednesday, images began circulating from the city of Raqqa in Syria of a man being thrown off a building, allegedly after a conviction for a homosexual act. The scene is sickening and horrifying. And it's meant to be, because ISIS is not only killing individuals it accuses of homosexuality -- it is trying to spread terror among people who do not conform to traditional ideas about what women and men should look like, do, or say. This latest execution is the eighth that ISIS has claimed it carried out for sodomy. In addition, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has reported the murders of four more men, also accused of sodomy, who were killed in similar style by ISIS in Syria. ISIS is allegedly also responsible for stoning at least three women in Syria accused of adultery. It's clear that these chilling spectacles are staged with the intent to terrorize. Some of the men were photographed either being thrown from the tops of tall buildings or stoned or shot to death (and in some cases both). In its social media postings about the executions, ISIS shows victims being brought to a city center, with militants purporting to read from a self-styled \"court\" ruling before conducting the execution in front of a crowd. A final picture usually depicts a lifeless body. The militia's propaganda machine gathers local communities and posts images on social media with a clear intention: to warn against any kind of transgression and spread terror. The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), of course, condemns these acts. But it is also important to note that we have very little information on the executions themselves. Indeed, despite our efforts, and those of other independent observers, neither the accusations nor the exact nature, time, and location of the executions can be corroborated. We know nothing about the victims' sexual orientation or gender identity. Without evidence or independent confirmation, we must therefore be cautious about assuming anything about the individuals involved. Still, whatever the uncertainties in these individual cases, as IGLHRC and the women's rights organization MADRE have\u00a0asserted, the public and gruesome nature of these executions, and ISIS's previous threats against those who commit what they deem to be \"sodomy,\" raise concerns for anyone in Iraq or Syria who does not conform to traditional ideas about \"proper\" women and men. And the reality is that these most recent executions are certain to heighten alarm and psychological suffering among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals -- and indeed terrorize the population generally -- in the areas under ISIS's control. For Iraqi individuals who are perceived to deviate from prevailing gender norms, living under the rule of ISIS means living with the constant shadow of a potential death sentence, as pointed out in our report with MADRE and the Baghdad-based Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq. Where do we go from here? There are no shortcuts or easy answers to stopping the violence of ISIS. The antidote to their bleak worldview will be long-term and hard-won, rooted in the tenacity and wisdom of resilient local communities. However, the international community must act urgently to protect lives and help those fleeing violence today. Internal and external resettlement of persecuted people should be stepped up with greater financial support to U.N. agencies and human rights NGOs who work directly with vulnerable people. Meanwhile, applications for asylum by persecuted individuals should be expedited. We cannot sit idly by while ISIS commits wanton violence in the name of protecting \"morality.\"\n",

According to a new survey, bingeing on TV box sets is now our top 'lights on' bedroom activity with 34 per cent delaying much-needed kip just to watch their favourite shows. As a nation our average bed time is 10.43pm, but we're busy for nearly an hour (52 minutes) before we actually go to sleep, according to new research. Binge-watching box sets is number one sleep-stealers with 34 per cent watching DVDs in bed . The survey of 1,000 adults, which excluded sex as an option, found that binge-watching DVDs or streamed programmes from the internet is now the number one sleep-stealer. Checking social media feeds was still a high second at 30 per cent, followed by writing emails or working (17 per cent), online shopping (11 per cent) and reading at just four per cent. Guilty pleasures such as eating biscuits, having a cuppa away from the rest of the family and playing addictive games like Candy Crush also sneaked into the top answers in a poll by The Fine Bedding Company. Although 83 per cent questioned claimed to love sleep, and that it was more important to them than food (66 per cent), we're actually getting less and less every year. According to the survey, the average amount of sleep is now six hours 28 minutes, compared to our grandparents' generation who got a good eight hours every night. Although 56 per cent of us claim to be unsatisfied with the amount of sleep we have every night, but we can't seem to tear ourselves away from our favourite shows. Some respondents admitting that it was all too easy to press play again and miss out on beauty sleep. A minority will enjoy a snack in bed and a moment alone, while one per cent of us admit Candy Crush keeps them awake in bed when they should have turned their lights out . 1.

Drinking/eating/snacks/treats 1.2% . 7. Playing online games/gambling 1.2% . It seems there is also a male/female divide when it comes to going to bed times, with the majority of men questioned saying they go to bed between 11pm and midnight, but most women were already snuggled up an hour earlier between 10 and 11pm. Sara Wadsworth of The Fine Bedding Company said: 'It seems we are becoming a nation of binge-watchers, unable to wait another week for the next episode. 'Perhaps it's time to bring a bit of balance back into the bedroom and try some sleep-enhancing activities a few nights a week. Instead of switching on a screen; try some gentle yoga stretches, listening to soothing music or even meditating. 'There are lots of apps available designed to enhance sleep and can easily be listened to in bed, putting that mobile phone to good use.'

We've been known to get that much in one day.\" In 18 hours, actually. It's not an official record yet, but it looks like the Italian village got 100.8 inches (256 centimeters) on Thursday, setting the all-time mark for most snow in 24 hours. Pescocostanzo, about 21 miles (34.6 kilometers) away, only got 94.5 inches (240 cm). That's more than Boston got in January and February combined, but just short of the 105.7 inches the city totaled so far for the whole season. One of the photos posted on MeteoWeb, the Italian weather website that reported the immense snowfall, showed a resident standing on top of the accumulation shaking hands with a neighbor. She is in a second-story window. The town, which has about 1,000 residents and sits at an altitude of 4,662 feet (1,421 meters), is prone to heavy one-day snowfalls, MeteoWeb reported. You might conclude it's in the Italian Alps given all that snow, but that's not the case. It's about a three-hour drive east of Rome, roughly halfway down the Italian Peninsula, not far from the Adriatic Sea. But it is in the mountains and is vulnerable to weather coming from the northeast. The World Meteorological Organization will confirm whether the snowfall actually surpassed the 24-hour snowfall record -- 75.8 inches -- from Silver Lake, Colorado, set in 1921.

It's the aftermath of an all-out melee in a Walmart parking lot in Cottonwood, Arizona, a town of 11,000 people about an hour's drive south of Flagstaff. But details are murky outside of the injury and arrest reports. What's known, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety statement released by spokesman Raul Garcia, is that someone at the store called the Cottonwood Police Department a few minutes before midnight Saturday to report that a woman who worked at Walmart \"had been assaulted in the store by multiple suspects.\" The suspects were in the parking lot when police responded, and they immediately attacked the officers, the DPS statement said. Two suspects were shot, one in the abdomen and one fatally, while one of the suspects shot a Cottonwood officer in the leg, according to DPS. \"I heard about eight to 10 shots,\" Louie Solano, an eyewitness, told CNN affiliate KPHO. \"It was a lot of noise. It looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot. I mean it was unbelievable,\" he said. Investigators believe the nine suspects were all from the same family. \"We believe they are from Idaho because of the license plate on their vehicle,\" DPS spokesman Bart Graves told CNN. The condition of the suspect who was shot in the stomach was not known. Seven other suspects were taken into custody, the statement said, and \"a total of eight officers and another (Walmart) employee were assaulted in the parking lot during the fight. Seven of those officers sustained minor injuries to include lacerations and bruising.\" The Walmart employee, who was a loss prevention officer, had a broken arm, Graves said. The 31-year-old officer who suffered the gunshot wound was flown to Flagstaff Medical Center, where he underwent surgery. The veteran officer is expected to make a full recovery, according to the statement. The Cottonwood Police Department and the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office directed media questions to DPS. Asked for additional information, Arizona DPS spokesman Bart Graves said, \"This is a very complex investigation, we are still sorting things out and there are a lot of witnesses to talk to, so we are in the early stages.\" He added, \"We were asked by Cottonwood police to conduct a criminal investigation.\" CNN's Brian Carberry contributed to this report.\n",

Bruce was only kept from getting to Poyet by the intervention of assistant referee Stuart Burt and he was formally reminded of his responsibilities on Thursday. Poyet, however, was charged by the FA, although Sportsmail understands it is likely he will be fined rather than hit with a touchline ban. He refused to apologise for his behaviour following the game but will accept the charge of improper conduct, to which he must respond by 6pm on Monday. Steve Bruce's son Alex (left) did not appear to make contact with Rodwell (right), who fell to the floor . The 1-1 draw leaves both sides still fighting for their Premier League survival this season . Hull are 15th in the table with 27 points while Sunderland are just one point behind them in 16th .\n",

Only the waiter and single dad from Wichita, Kansas, has struggled with dental issues since he was a child, after chipping one of his front teeth lead to a series of infections that he has never been able to get on top of. It was something that struck Fred Boettcher, an attorney from Oklahoma, who was in town catching up with his daughter at the Doo-Dah Diner, where Maixner works. 'I took one look at this young man and knew he was something special,' Boettcher told KWCH 12. 'He carried himself with such kindness and confidence with a mouth that looked painful. I was struck by that.' Problem: Waiter Brian Maixner has suffered\u00a0severe dental decay across his mouth since he was a child, but could not afford to have it fixed . Ongoing issues: Maixner, a single father, said his dental problems started when he chipped a front tooth at a child, leading to a variety of other issues he hasn't been able to afford to get fixed . Boettcher decided he wanted to help Maixner, who was until that point a complete stranger. He went over and spoke to Maixner's manager, and told her he was leaving behind a $25,000 tip to help him get a new set of teeth. 'This man doesn't know me and this is something I could never afford to do for myself,' Maixner said, admitting he burst into tears when his manager told him the news. 'It touched me so much that he cared.' The grand gesture came at no surprise to Boettcher's daughter. 'Dad gives so much, I remember him buying groceries for people in need when we were growing up,' Meredith Boettcher Young said. New reason to smile: Last week Maixner underwent a number of procedures and now has a whole new set of teeth, thanks to the generosity of a random customer . Overjoyed: 'This has been a complete life changer,' Brian Maixner said of his new chompers . Kind-hearted:\u00a0Fred Boettcher was visiting his daughter Meredith (pictured together) in Wichita when he noticed Maixner and decided he wanted to help . Before:\u00a0Brian Maixner had always been self-concious of his smile, growing up with teeth problems that had lasted well into adulthood, but that has changed thanks to customer Fred Boettcher (left) New man:\u00a0After years of painful dental problems, Brian Maixner got thousands of dollars of work done on his teeth\u2014all without paying a penny, thanks to a generous diner who wanted to help . Maixner has since undergone a number of procedures and now has a complete new set of top front teeth. The dental work has changed his life, he says, with friends, family and regular customers shocked at the difference it has made. However no one seems happier about what happened than the person responsible,\u00a0Boettcher. No matter what religion you might be or whether you even believe in an after life the way to be satisfied in your life is to be kind to everybody and be as generous as you possibly can be,\" Boettcher said. 'As happy as that fella may be it feels so much better to be able to put a smile on his face.'\n",

        "input": "The Delhi gang-rape victim's father has called on all countrymen to watch a banned documentary which showed his daughter's killer blaming the student for 'being out at night'. India's Daughter was described as the 'bitter truth' by the young woman's father after it quoted the views of her rapist\u00a0Mukesh Singh, who is on death row over the 2012 attack. The film by award-winning Briton Leslee Udwin, who produced 1999 indie hit East is East, was due to air on the BBC and Indian news channel NDTV to mark International Women's Day this Sunday. But it was dropped by NDTV following a ban on the film by the Indian government, and the BBC brought forward its screening to last night, citing a strong public interest. Scroll down for video . 'Everyone should see it': The father of the New Delhi bus gang-rape victim (pictured left with her mother) has urged his countrymen to watch a BBC documentary on the crime despite India's government banning it . Today India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh vowed there would be consequences for the Corporation, telling NDTV: 'We had asked to not release the documentary but BBC still released it. 'We will investigate and the MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) will take action accordingly. The conditions have been breached so action will be taken accordingly. I won't comment any further.' The hour-long documentary aired as part of the long-running Storyville series on BBC Four, and is believed to have been accessed by many in India on sites such as YouTube. Today the victim's family showed their support for the film, saying the rapist's comments had to be be exposed because they expressed how many people still think. The victim's father, who is named in the documentary but kept anonymous by some international news agencies, told NDTV the film was 'the bitter truth'. Horror: The crew obtained an interview with killer Mukesh Singh, who said the student was to blame . 'Everyone should watch the film,' he said.\u00a0'If a man can speak like that in jail, imagine what he would say if he was walking free?' The victim's mother added she did not object to the ban but believed Singh's views were widespread in India. 'I don't care what the government does, bans the film, doesn't ban the film, the only thing I know is that nobody is afraid,' she said. 'It is not only Mukesh who thinks like this.' Mukesh Singh was one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the physiotherapy student, who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in December 2012. Once inside, bus driver Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager launched the attack. The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death. She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines. Her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape. Yet many still hold the firm belief that women are subservient - illustrated by convict Singh, who told the documentary his victim would still be alive if she had not objected. 'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back,' he said. 'She should just be silent and allow the rape... Then they'd have dropped her off after \"doing her\", and only hit [her friend] the boy.' He claimed 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two' and insisted:\u00a0'A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night. Film-maker Leslee Udwin, an award-winner who produced the 1999 hit East is East, said: 'The more they try to stop the film, the more they are going to pique people's interest. Now, everyone is going to want to see it' Protest: Jyoti's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second-class citizens . 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. 'About 20 per cent of girls are good.' The views, which have prompted horror around the world, are not exclusive to the girl's attacker. The rapists' own defence lawyer ML Sharma told the documentary: 'We have the best culture. In our culture, there is no place for a woman.' Home Minister Rajnath Singh said of the film: 'Under no circumstances should this be telecast' A second defence lawyer, AP Singh, said if his daughter or sister 'engaged in pre-marital activities... in front of my entire family, I would put petrol on her and set her alight'. The exact reasons for the government's ban were initially mired in confusion. Home Minister Rajnath Singh told parliament yesterday that the government sought the ban because Singh's comments were 'highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women'. One government minister, M Venkaiah Naidu, called it a 'conspiracy to defame India'. There were heated questions over how the documentary crew gained permission to interview the convicted rapist amid concerns he was being given a platform. Spokesman Rajan Bhagat said the New Delhi police had petitioned the court for a ban on the grounds that the film's 'objectionable content' could cause public disorder. Yet campaigners criticised the government for appearing more worried about the country's reputation than about the dangers women face. 'Banning this movie is not the answer,' said Anu Agha, an independent MP. 'We have to confront the issue that men in India do not respect women and any time there is a rape, blame is put on the woman.' Film-maker Ms Udwin said:\u00a0'The more they try to stop the film, the more they are going to pique people's interest. Now, everyone is going to want to see it.' Mass protests: The December 2012 gang-rape and murder of a young physiotherapy student highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in India and led to a major reform of the country's rape laws .\n",

The Slovakia defender is alleged to have deliberately trodden on goalkeeper David de Gea towards the end of United\u2019s 2-1 win at Anfield on Sunday, leading to an angry confrontation between the two players after the final whistle. The FA were able to take action after referee Martin Atkinson confirmed that he did not see the incident, and a three-man panel unanimously agreed that it was a red card offence. Skrtel, 30, has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge. Martin Skrtel's foot lands on David de Gea's leg, with the FA to decide whether there was any intent . Skrtel avoided any punishment at the time, with Martin Atkinson blowing for full time seconds later . Liverpool could easily have lost a second player at the very end of the game when Skrtel followed through on David De Gea but Atkinson showed a consistent approach and let the game end in a deserved away win. Teammate Steven Gerrard has already been hit with a three-match ban after he was sent off for stamping on Ander Herrera just 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute.

The centre-back was pushed forward in search of an equaliser and trod on De Gea as the United goalkeeper slid in to gather the ball at his feet. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers admitted that the video footage did not look good in slow motion, but insisted that Skrtel was going for the ball.

Courtney Wells, of Birmingham, was one of thousands of children in England who were left disappointed after they missed out on their first choice secondary school place when they were notified yesterday. Her parents listed four schools in order of preference for their daughter but missed out on them all. Instead the 11-year-old, who is due to start year seven in September, has been offered a place at\u00a0Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre. The school became an academy last November after it was placed in special measures in 2013 following a damning Ofsted report which rated it 'inadequate'. Courtney's mother Stacey Wells, 31, said: 'Courtney was really engaged in the whole process of deciding what school she wanted to go to. She went to look at all the schools. Courtney Wells, 11, missed out on all four of her choices for Birmingham secondary schools and was instead offered a place at an academy previously in special measures. Her mother Stacey is appealing the decision . 'We put a white board up in the kitchen and after each open evening she weighed up the pros and cons and gave the school a score out of ten. That's how she decided which schools she would choose. 'We are not wholly surprised that she didn't get into the university school as it looked so amazing that we were expecting it to be inundated with applicants. But we thought she would at least get one of her other choices. Birmingham was one of the worst areas where children missed out on their first choices as secondary school places were confirmed yesterday. A third of children in the city missed out on their first choice school compared to just two per cent in Cornwall. Councils notified parents of their children's fate yesterday by email or letter, meaning some families will not receive the news for several days. Courtney was rejected from her first choice University of Birmingham School (top left), which is being built, her second Shenley Academy (top right), which is closer to her home than the place she has. She was refused her third St Paul's School for Girls (bottom left) and her fourth, Colmers Senior School (bottom right) The 11-year-old applied for four schools - three of which were within 2.5 miles of her home but was rejected and given a place at Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre which was put into special measures in 2013 . 'It is such a worrying time, all we want is the best for our daughter. We are going to appeal and fight this all the way.' The decision to offer Courtney a place at the academy came despite the site being further away from her home than her second choice school. She was also rejected from Colmers School in Rednal, despite having a foster sibling already at the school. Her parents have vowed to appeal the decision. They decided to put just four choices on the form instead of take advantage of listing six options because they thought this would be enough. They listed\u00a0University of Birmingham School, Selly Oak; Shenley Academy, Northfield; St Paul's School for Girls, Edgbaston and Colmers School, Rednal, as their choices. Courtney was rejected from all four of her secondary school choices, despite her second preference being closer to her home and one of her choices being at a school where one of her foster siblings is a pupil . She has been offered a place at Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre, put in special measures in 2013 . The couple's first choice for their daughter, currently a pupil at St Brigid's RC Primary School in Northfield, was the new University of Birmingham School, which is opening its doors for the first time in September. A spokeswoman for the school said it had received a staggering 1,100 applications for its 150 places, with 377 pupils putting it as their first choice. Courtney's parents have been told their daughter is currently in 177th place on the waiting list for a place at the sought-after free school, which is financially backed by the university and which has promised it will provide a private education standard without charging fees. The Year 7 intake will consist of 75 pupils living around its site in Bristol Road, Selly Oak, while another 75 will come from homes near Hall Green, Small Heath and the Jewellery Quarter railway stations. Peter Hay, Birmingham City Council's director of people, said: 'If you have applied for an academy, foundation, grammar, voluntary aided or free school and want to appeal against their decision, then you must contact that school directly for details of their appeal arrangements.' Under the admissions system, families list their school preferences and are then allocated places according to the schools\u2019 admissions criteria. Many children living in big cities were left disappointed yesterday, and this graph shows the percentage of children who got their first choice secondary school when the places were announced on Monday . Factors can include proximity to the school, faith or ability \u2013 with some schools specifying how many bright, average and low ability pupils they will admit. A spokesman for the council said: 'The school admissions team has processed over 15,000 applications for secondary school places this year. Parents in Birmingham can submit up to six preferences, including grammar schools, and we always advise that parents are realistic when making their preferences. 'The advice from the local authority is that parents include at least one preference for a nearby school where their child would have got in under the distance criterion in the past. For the vast majority of families the reason they do not get the first preference is because other children better met the school's admission criteria than their child.' Yesterday more than half a million pupils were notified of their places and a number of appeals are expected.\n",

Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston is facing a ban from football activities after being charged by the Football Association for input messages in which he called a supporter 'a retard'. The unpopular chief has until next Monday to respond to the charge and is set to be locked out of his own club if ultimately found guilty. Oyston - who has been the constant target of fan protests over the course of the Seasiders\u2019 worst season for decades - is also looking at a hefty fine and mandatory four-hour FA education course. The shocking input messages, seen by Sportsmail, emerged just before Christmas when he sent a series of vitriolic volleys to fan Stephen Smith, who he told to 'enjoy the rest of your special needs day out'. Oyston later apologised for his part in the exchange, however the FA announced on Monday that the messages allegedly constituted five breaches of its rules and now has until 6pm on March 30 to respond to the charge. In a another rant from Oyston, who has had abuse hurled at him as well this season, read: 'Stop inputing f******, you shouldn't have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium. 'You are banned because I think you are a p****. 'Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you.' Oyston has also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool, a Premier League side four years ago, spiral down to the Conference, with another input reading: 'I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission'. Blackpool's fans protest against Oyston during the game against Charlton . A statement on the FA's website read: 'Blackpool FC Chairman Karl Oyston has been charged by the FA in relation to comments made in a input message exchange. 'It is alleged that the misconduct constituted five breaches of FA rules, and that during the input message exchange, Mr Oyston used abusive and/or insulting words towards a supporter of Blackpool FC. 'It is further alleged that each of these five breaches of FA Rule E3(1) is an 'Aggravated Breach' as defined in Rule E3(2), as each included a reference to disability. 'Mr Oyston has until 6pm on March 30, 2015 to respond to the charge.' The content of the messages first emerged just before Christmas and Oyston came under fire from fans of his own club as well as anti-discrimination group Kick It Out, while the local paper the Blackpool Gazette scrapped his weekly column with immediate effect. Blackpool fans have made their dislike for Oyston clear this season with songs and banners . The Seasiders chairman issued an apology via the club's official website in which he explained he was responding to threats and abuse to his own family. 'I would like to unreservedly apologise for any offence or distress caused by my input responses reported in the media recently,' he said. 'I regret stooping to the level of those threatening and abusing my family. 'My mobile number was placed on a social media website recently and it led to a barrage of abuse about my mother, father, wife, children and myself. 'In hindsight the aim of this was clear, and I foolishly opted to challenge some of the abuse, harassment and threats. 'Given my position, I should have acted with more responsibility and reported the abusive input messages, phone calls and answer phone messages to the police, rather than get embroiled in such an exchange.' Blackpool fans have held a number of protests about Oyston . However, Smith said at the time that he had not accepted Oyston's apology. Smith also claimed Oyston's position at the helm of Blackpool had become 'untenable'. 'The apology is weak,' he said. 'He has said that he is responding to messages that threatened and abused his family. I did not threaten or abuse any member of his family. His position as chairman is untenable. He has no choice but to resign.' Oyston has endured a frosty relationship with Blackpool supporters who have been disillusioned by events on and off the field during a tumultuous year at Bloomfield Road. Last Saturday hundreds of fans protested against the Tangerines' ownership and opted to go and watch non-league AFC Blackpool instead, boycotting the fixture between Lee Clark's men and Leeds. Blackpool are 17 points away from safety in the Sky Bet Championship and their relegation could be confirmed in their next game against Bolton.\n",

Donald Tusk, the president of the European council representing EU leaders, said he was 'ready to help Cameron' \u2013 but dismissed his chances of negotiating a new European treaty within the next two years before holding an EU referendum. The former Polish prime minister said it would be hard to find agreement among all 27 EU leaders that would satisfy Mr Cameron. He said: 'I have no doubt that we have to help in a limited and rational framework. We have to help David Cameron because he is obviously pro-European. But Mr Tusk added: 'I am sceptical when it comes to changing the treaty.' Mr Cameron wants a new Brussels treaty to nail down a series of changes allowing Britain to limit benefits for EU migrants. The PM has insisted that new rules are needed to help the crisis-hit Eurozone, giving Britain the chance to renegotiate its relationship with Brussels. But Mr Tusk said: 'My intuition is that treaty change is close to mission impossible today because it's not only about rationality, about good argument. 'We need unanimity between 28 member states, in the European parliament, in 28 national parliaments in the process of ratification. To say that it is a Pandora's Box is too little.' Mr Tusk said: 'First of all we need more precise concrete [details] about British demands. 'When we have more information about details, about legal problems, then we can decide if discussion about treaty change is at all necessary. 'For me the problem of possible treaty change is a practical question. It's not only about the arguments of Cameron. I can agree or disagree with some of them. 'But at the end of the day I would like to ask him 'what is your concrete proposal?' and then I can consult with the other member states.' Mr Tusk, the former Polish prime minister likened David Cameron's chances of negotiating a new EU treaty by 2017 to the Tom Cruise blockbusters 'Mission Impossible' But he said: 'We need, also for the United Kingdom, a good solution for Cameron and Great Britain under existing law,' he said. 'We need the United Kingdom in Europe. For me there's no more obvious political thesis than this one. And I feel, but it's not my role to decide about it, but I feel that the United Kingdom needs Europe.' The former Polish prime minister's remarks are the first since he took over as European council president in December. He also admitted, in an interview with the Guardian, that he will find it hard to crack down on immigration \u2013 because of the number of Poles living and working abroad. He said: 'It's not easy for me because of some expectations close to the immigration problems, which means also the huge Polish minority in Great Britain.'\n",

Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the rules will apply to any regular aircraft carrying 50 passengers or more and will 'take effect immediately'. French prosecutors allege Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of downed flight 4U9525, plunged his plane into an Alpine ravine on March 24 after locking his captain out of the cockpit. Qantas has announced that it is discussions with regulators over it's cockpit policies . ''Today's decision is a sensible, measured response that combines safeguarding the travelling public with the practical capabilities of the aviation sector,' Mr Truss said in a statement. A spokesman for Qantas, the nation's biggest airline, said the new arrangement would apply to Qantas, QantasLink, Network Aviation and Jetstar flights. 'When one pilot needs to leave the cockpit for any reason, another authorised person will occupy the jump seat,' the spokesman said. The spokesman said the airline has 'numerous layers of screening and support for pilots'. That includes medical checks, stress management training, confidential counselling and psychometric testing during recruitment. In the UK, a few airlines have announced the new move will come into force tomorrow and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across all airlines . Qantas have said that they are still considering whether or not their policies need to be tightened . In a statement released to Daily Mail Australia last week, Virgin Australia said their pilots also undergo medical exams. The airline said they are constantly in contact with regulatory bodies and have comprehensive measures in place on all flights to ensure the safety of guests and crew. However they said that those details were to remain confidential for security purposes . 'The Virgin Australia Group continuously undertakes detailed risk reviews, including consultation with the relevant regulatory and industry bodies. Any updates regarding changes to our processes will be provided where appropriate,' a Virgin spokesperson said. 'All Virgin Australia Group Pilots undertake regular aeromedical exams, which include mental health assessments.' Airlines and aviation regulators around the world last week began taking steps to ensure there are always two people in the cockpit. Tragedy: It emerged today that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked the plane's pilot out of the cockpit and 'deliberately' crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing 150 people on board . Lubitz was sitting in this cockpit, pictured, when he commanded the jet to crash into the Alps at 400mph . In the UK, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic announced plans to change their aviation policy on staff numbers in the cockpit. Monarch and Thomas Cook also confirmed they had changed their policies, while Ryanair, Jet2 and Flybe said they already required two crew members to be in the cockpit at all times. Elsewhere around Europe, the continent's third-largest budget carrier, Norwegian Air Shuttle, said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: 'Following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic Germanwings incident, we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and have contacted all UK operators to require them to review all relevant procedures. Horror: After voice recordings emerged from the doomed A320 revealing how the pilot tried to kick down the cockpit door,\u00a0EasyJet said a cabin crew member will enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet . 'All UK airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence. As part of this, aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot's mental health at each medical examination which, for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot, is undertaken annually. 'These detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards. 'We will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident.' Doomed: The captain of the ill-fated flight - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter (file photo) 'Deliberate': Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually . Heart-broken: Family of the victims of the crash gathered near the scene in Le Vernet near the French Alps today, as rescuers tried to recover the dead bodies of their deceased relatives . Rescue: Helicopters lowered investigators down to the scene of the obliterated plane where debris and human remains were scattered . Raid: German police have investigated Andreas Lubitz's \u20ac500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf .

The so-called \u2018health tourism gap\u2019 between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost \u00a3700million. It means the UK is now paying out \u00a315 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill abroad for every \u00a31 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors. The Prime Minister and Health Secretary have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra \u00a3500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18. Both GPs and hospitals will be given incentives to identify non-British users of the NHS and payment procedures will be made easier. However, the latest Department of Health statistics indicate there is a long way to go. Released following a Freedom of Information request, they show that in 2013/14, British taxpayers handed \u00a3749.8million to European governments to pay for the care of UK citizens abroad. This has risen by \u00a3100million from \u00a3649.3million just a year before. But in the same period, the NHS managed to collect only \u00a350.3million from European countries to pay for the care of their citizens who needed treatment here. This is an increase on the \u00a332million total the year before \u2013 but the number is still dwarfed by money going the other way. Ministers believe part of the problem is that hospitals do not ask enough questions to identify patients who should be paying for treatment. Figures which emerged at the weekend show the NHS is still chasing at least \u00a362million of unpaid bills for foreigners\u2019 care. One London hospital trust alone \u2013 King\u2019s College \u2013 is owed almost \u00a318million from overseas patients. One single patient at a different trust racked up an unpaid bill of more than \u00a3420,000. Others owe more than \u00a3100,000 for treatments including dialysis, bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, according to The Sunday Times. Health minister Dan Poulter was even photographed with a new mother from Zimbabwe who is still being pursued for a \u00a33,000 bill. Two years ago, cancer specialist Professor J Meirion Thomas warned many foreigners were travelling to Britain for expensive treatment and then leaving without paying. He said the NHS was also becoming the \u2018world\u2019s maternity wing\u2019. Last night Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, said: \u2018We\u2019re fortunate to have one of the only truly free at the point of need health services in the world. \u2018But we are not the International Health Service, it\u2019s the National Health Service. This is an issue which needs to be addressed.\u2019 Ukip health spokesman Louise Bours said: \u2018It is clear from these figures that hospitals in this country are way too lax in chasing up payment for health treatment for EU citizens.\u2019 Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right,\u00a0have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra \u00a3500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18 . Part of the gap is due to the fact that so many British pensioners retire to the continent. There may also be more tourists from Britain travelling to mainland Europe than the other way round. But there are more than a million migrant workers from the EU here, against far fewer Britons employed in other European countries. Under EU arrangements, UK citizens can be treated by other nations\u2019 health services and the bill is sent back to Britain. In theory, these European nations should also be billed when their citizens are treated by the NHS. In 2013/14, the UK paid Ireland \u00a3246million for treating Britons who fell ill there. Only \u00a322million came back the other way. Some \u00a3250million was paid to Spain but only \u00a33.2million came back. France received \u00a3152million but returned just \u00a37million. Italy got \u00a36.2million and sent back \u00a31.1million, while Greece collected \u00a38.9million and returned \u00a3400,000. A Department of Health spokesman said: \u2018We want international visitors to feel welcome to use the NHS, provided they pay for it \u2013 just as families in the UK do through their taxes. \u2018Our plans will help recoup up to \u00a3500million a year by 2017/18.\u2019 Jonathan Isaby, chief executive at the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018Emergency medical treatment is one thing, but taxpayers cannot be expected to pick up the bill for expensive longer-term treatment for tourists. \u2018Our authorities must do better to claw back the amount owed by visitors.' Zimbabwean-born Caroline Nyadzyao, who is being chased for \u00a33,000 by the NHS after giving birth in a Norfolk hospital, meets with health minister Daniel Poulter . Smiling alongside a health minister at a Norfolk maternity unit in 2013, this new mum is still being chased for the \u00a33,000 it cost the NHS to help her give birth. Zimbabwe-born Caroline Nyadzayo\u2019s unpaid bill is part of the \u00a362million cost of \u2018health tourism\u2019 to Britain. The 34-year-old, an advertising executive in Africa, was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter on his visit to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital when the maternity suite was reopened. The mum said she complained to Mr Poulter about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it. But Mr Poulter has reportedly said he does not remember being told that. Miss Nyadzayo, now in Harare, told the Sunday Times it was \u2018unfair \u2019 she was still being pursued, because the baby\u2019s father is British. She said: \u2018I know the system may believe I travelled to abuse the NHS benefits, but... I just wanted to have my first baby as a family and surely everyone is entitled to that?\u2019 The couple were questioned about the birth when they entered Britain at Norwich Airport in October 2013. However, they were released when they agreed they would be paying for it. Miss Nyadzayo said: \u2018I was told because I was 31 weeks\u2019 pregnant it was likely I was going to use the NHS to my advantage. We said we would pay for the birth. But we had no idea how much we\u2019d be charged.\u2019\n",

        "input": "A North Carolina man pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six to 10 years in prison on Wednesday for handcuffing an 11-year-old boy by his ankle to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck as punishment. Former Emergency Room nurse Dorian Harper entered the plea to three felonies, including child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and maiming without malice. His plea came a day after a jury was seated in the case. 'Yes, sir,' Harper, 58, said when the trial judge asked if he was guilty. Dorian Harper (left) pleaded guilty on Wednesday to handcuffing his girlfriend Wanda Larson's (right) foster son, 11, to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck as a punishment . Harper rejected prosecutors' plea deal Monday, saying he wanted the trial to go on. He and his girlfriend, 58-year-old Wanda Larson, were arrested after a sheriff's deputy found the boy in November 2013. 'This is a very serious case, with very serious implications for Mr. Harper,' Judge Brad Long told the jury Tuesday. Larson was the boy's guardian and a Department of Social Services supervisor in Union County. Larson faces similar charges. She has pleaded not guilty. Authorities said they think Harper tied the dead chicken around the boy's neck as punishment for killing one of the chickens on the 5-acre farm where they lived. The indictment against the couple said the boy had been subject to abuse that also included being chained to a piece of railroad track in his room. Harper cut the boy's face with a knife and used an electric wire to burn his face, according to the indictment. The chicken: Dorian Harper is guilty of chaining his 11-year-old foster son to the porch with this chicken tied around his neck as a punishment . It also said the boy once broke his wrist trying to escape. Four other children \u2014 ages 7 to 14, all adopted by Larson \u2014 were removed from the home after Harper and Larson were arrested. They also had one 20-year-old adopted son. After his arrest, Harper lost his job as an emergency room nurse and Larson lost her county job working for social services. After the incident in the 2013, the 20-year-old, who didn't want to be named, said his adopted parents Wanda Larson and Dorian Harper provided a 'loving and caring home' but the boy has severe psychological issues, including a history of being cruel to animals. He said his parents' punishment, though he didn't condone it, was a last ditch attempt to control the child's behavior and protect the rest of the household. Everyone says this is some sweet innocent kid when in actuality, he is not. He has been to counseling, he is on numerous heavy medications, but nothing has worked,' the brother told KHOU in 2013. The brother said he believes the chicken around the neck was supposed to 'shame the child.' 'There has to be something going on, between that child and that chicken,' he said. 'He either, one, didn't feed it and it died, or two, either he was out there harassing the chicken. He may have killed the chicken. This child has been known to be cruel to animals.' He said the controversial discipline was his father's doing, as his mother, who would have put a stop to it, wasn't home at the time. The brother explained the 11-year-old, who had lived at the home since he was six, was a problem child who was underweight because of a health problem, not because he was being mistreated. 'He would sneak out into the garage take raw meat out of the freezer, let it thaw overnight and next day go out there and eat it raw,' the man, who moved out of the home two years ago, when he turned 18, told KHOU. The home: Police and neighbors described the family's home as being covered in feces with such a pungent smell it 'takes your breath away' 'He has severe psychological issues.' 'He was not allowed to carry his own lunch box because would eat what food is in his lunch and then, throw the lunch box away and say he didn't have lunch for the day.' Union County Sheriff deputies plan to interview the other four children to get a clearer view of their living environment. But the brother insisted his parents cared for the children. 'Everyone assumed all five children in the home have been abused, that is not accurate. You ask all four of the children, they will say they lived in a loving and caring home,' he said. The account contradicts claims from the 11-year-old's relatives who say they have tried for years to get DSS to look into the allegations of abuse. Union County Sheriff Animal Services were at the house early this week gathering the property's remaining animals, including an estimated 75 fowl (chicken, ducks, guineas and peacock) three horses, three donkeys, two llamas, eight dogs and a hog. It was revealed the boy was routinely handcuffed to a piece of steel inside the farm house in Union Country by his foster parents, who were preventing him from running away. Police in North Carolina have released more information on the shocking case - including how the smell of the feces-covered house would 'take your breath away' - as neighbors come forward describing how the boy would beg them for food and, at one point, was 'purple with cold' and 'looked pitiful'. Disturbing: Larson, a former child services worker, lived at this property with four adopted children and the 11-year-old who was the only foster child . Another neighbor, who asked not to be named, said a boy appeared on her porch in May 2012 'purple with cold, with no coat, saying he was hungry'. 'When asked, he said he had no mother or father and didn't know where he lived,' she said. The woman brought him inside and fed him a sandwich. 'It didn\u2019t take him 10 seconds to eat it,' she said. He told her he was 10-years-old and that he had slept in her barn, behind her house, the night before. When she told him she would take him home, she said, he answered: 'No. I want to stay here.' Her daughter called 911 and a sheriff's deputy came out, spoke with the boy, made a phone call, then told him she'd take him home. 'He didn't refuse. He just went with her.' The neighbor said the deputy let her know she had returned him to his foster parents and said the man insisted the boy hadn't been missing more than 30 minutes. The neighbor believes it was the Harper-Larson home. 'I know that\u2019s where she took him (although) you can\u2019t see the house from the road.' Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said said the condition of the house was 'terrible'. 'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,' he said. Chance finding: Authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to this porch . 'The bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. Sink was trashed. No running water. The smell took your breath away.' All the children appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said that the first thing law enforcement did for them was buy them pizza. Authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to the porch. He approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch. According to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house. Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened. 'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday. 'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.'\n",

The AFA have engaged the QC and sports law expert Lord Pannick to fight their corner - with the threat of an injunction hovering over a summit with the FA called to resolve the issue. The AFA have engaged the QC and sports law expert Lord Pannick to fight their corner over new FA rules . The agents object to the way the FA intend to administer their lucrative work. This includes a reduction in fees, no pay for representing players under 18 and a free-for-all with no agent\u2019s licence required in future. Mel Stein, chairman of the AFA, said: \u2018There is no doubt that the upcoming regulations are unworkable and it will be an horrendous mess unless some agreement can be reached. At least finalising a meeting is some kind of progress.\u2019 The FA, who are understood to have chosen the successor to general secretary Alex Horne, were certainly aiming high with their original wish list. It is understood to have included Formula One Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who is said to have been asked whether he was interested in leaving his \u00a36million-a-year job in motor racing to earn 10 times less at Wembley. You can imagine his quick answer. It is understood Red Bull principal Christian Horner was asked to succeed FA general secretary Alex Horne . Former British No 1 tennis player Buster Mottram, better known for his extreme right-wing political views, has been barred from membership of the All England Club for six weeks. Mottram, 59, who plays regular social tennis at Wimbledon when not involved in games of bridge, refused to comment on the reasons for his suspension. The secretive club, who don\u2019t like talking about their internal business even when staging the Wimbledon Championships, also refused to discuss his misdemeanour. Buster Mottram, pictured in 1955, has been barred from membership of the All England Club for six weeks . The Welsh FA have expressed anger with the FA over their plans to field Team GB football teams at the Rio Olympics without consultation. Welsh FA president Trevor Lloyd-Hughes said he was \u2018livid and absolutely gutted with the English FA\u2019, while Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford wants to be involved in all decision-making around 2016, having been given the impression that participation in the 2012 London Games was going to be a one-off. The FA say they have asked the three other home nations where they stand. The Welsh FA were under the impression a Team GB football team at the 2012 Olympics was a one-off . DYKE COACHING ROW . There is a major split developing within the FA over chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s England Commission proposals to fund coaching development at the expense of cuts across the board. Dyke\u2019s initiative, with \u00a32.7million per year being switched from other parts of the FA budget to pay for 35 new coach educators to work in the grassroots (24) and professional game (11), has been approved by the FA board. But amateur blazers have yet to be convinced about the merits of such expenditure and the resulting 15 per cent cuts being imposed on every department to raise the cash. National game chairman Roger Burden has written to councillors to inform them of their colleagues\u2019 concern about the lack of consultation and their fears that the proposed reduction in FA Trophy and FA Vase prize-money may have a \u2018devastating effect\u2019 on some smaller clubs who rely on this money to stay afloat. An FA spokesman said the national game had four representatives on the FA board that has approved the proposal and it was up to individual departments where they made cuts. There are major splits developing within the FA over Greg Dyke's proposal to make cuts . England cricket chiefs Paul Downton and Peter Moores, having presided over abject preparation, performances and team selection at the World Cup, are fortunate the new ECB hierarchy had such low expectations. The high command are also busy with restructuring the organisation, so axeing the team leadership pair is not on their agenda. This probably means Downton and Moores will have this summer\u2019s Ashes series to secure their jobs.\n",

        "input": "A controversial red card for Wasps' Nathan Hughes saw Northampton come from behind to win a tumultuous clash 52-30 at Franklin's Gardens and move 14 points clear at the top of the Premiership. Hughes was sent off for kneeing Northampton and British Lions winger George North in the head as he scored Saints' and his second try. The Wasps number eight complained it was unintentional, but after watching replays on the big screen, referee Craig Maxwell-Keys decided to issue a red card five minutes before half-time. George North is treated for a head injury during the Aviva Premiership match at Franklin's Gardens . Nathan Hughes' knee collided with North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . The winger was knocked out immediately before receiving lengthy medical treatment for his knock . After suffering concussion in Wales's opening Six Nations match against England, when he was knocked out twice, there were worrying scenes as North lay motionless on the ground. He started moving shortly afterwards as medics attended to him before he was stretchered from the pitch. A minute before the incident, after 34 minutes, Alex Lozowski kicked a penalty to put Wasps 20-8 in front, but they went in 27-20 down at half-time after a dramatic turnaround saw Northampton add two tries from lineout drives after North's try. Hughes was sent off his tackle but felt aggrieved claiming it was an accidental collision at the try line . Northampton tweeted just before half-time that their star man had woken up from his terrible injury . And yet it was Hughes who inspired Wasps' opening try after four minutes when he turned over George Pisi on the visitors' 22. Wasps shifted the ball to the wing to set Christian Wade free, and speed home. Lozowski added the conversion. Northampton: Wilson; K. Pisi, G. Pisi, Stephenson, North; Myler, L. Dickson; Corbisiero, Hartley, Ma'afu, Lawes, C. Day, Wood, Clark, Manoa . Replacements: Haywood, A. Waller, Denman, S. Dickinson, Fisher, Fotuali'i, Waldouck, Tuala. Tries: North 2, penalty, Corbisiero, K. Pisi, Tuala 2 . Penalties: Myler 3 . Conversions: Myler 4 . Wasps: Miller; Wade, Daly, Downey, Tagicakibau; Lozowski, Simpson; Mullan, Shervington, Cittadini, Cannon, Myall, Johnson, Young, N. Hughes. Replacements: McIntyre, Swainston, Gaskell, E. Jackson, Thompson, Weepu, G. Hughes, W. Helu. Tries: Wade 3 . Penalties: Lozowski 3 . Conversions: Lozowski 3 . Referee: Craig Maxwell-Keys . Northampton hit straight back as Stephen Myler fired a crossfield kick into the arms of North to score, while Myler hit the post with the conversion to leave Wasps 7-5 in front. The home side were offside at the restart allowing Lozowski to add three more points and the fly-half then showed an electric turn of pace to skip through a gap to send Wade flying over, while Lozowski converted from the touchline to make it 17-5 after 20 minutes. Myler and Lozowski exchanged penalties, before the match-turning incident. Samu Manoa caught the re-start and sent North powering into the corner, but as he grounded the ball the Hughes ran into him, kneeing the Welsh winger in the head. North appeared knocked out, lying motionless for a short while. As the medics got to him he started moving and after a lengthy delay he was stretchered off. Meanwhile, Maxwell-Keys showed Hughes a red card. Hughes complained to the referee as he walked off and a Wasps water carrier - conditioning coach Dan Baugh - had to be pulled away as he argued with Saints forwards coach Dorian West on the touchline. After a long wait Myler missed the touchline conversion, but Saints had a penalty from the restart and Myler booted it into the corner. Saints' maul steamrollered towards the line only to be dragged down and Maxwell-Keys awarded a penalty try. Myler's conversion suddenly made it 20-20. Christian Wade of Wasps dives in to score his third try of the match but it wasn't enough for the win . On the brink of half-time, Saints kicked another penalty to the corner and as their maul piled towards the line, Alex Corbisiero broke off to touch down and Myler converted to make it 27-20. Facing 40 minutes with 14 men Lozowski kicked a penalty as Wasps moved number eight Ashley Johnson to hooker and managed to win a scrum against the head on Saints' 22. They moved the ball wide where Daly drew two men before offloading to Wade. Lozowski landed the touchline conversion to make it 33-30 with 11 minutes left. Courtney Lawes of Northampton Saints is tackled by Nathan Hughes before he was sent off . Stephen Myler prepares to kick a conversion after George North's try for the Northampton Saints . The comeback was short lived though, as three minutes later Ken Pisi touched down and two tries in two minutes from Ahsee Tuala, plus two conversions by Myler saw Northampton bring up the half-century. Referee Craig Maxwell-Keys angered Wasps director of rugby Dai Young by producing the card after watching replays. But Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder insisted: \u2018It was reckless coming in with the knee and some serious consequences happened because of that. The opposition have to be very careful once the try has been scored. North could now miss a number of games after fellow player Mike Brown was ruled out with a similar knock . The collision appeared accidental but it was deemed dangerous enough to send off the number eight . \u2018George is OK, he\u2019s come round, he\u2019s in the changing room and he is up and walking about. It\u2019s a knock to his head which is not good. We will look after him and we will make sure that he comes back when he is right.\u2019 Young claimed: \u2018When you slow anything down in slow-mo things look a bit worse. But once the crowd gets on a referee\u2019s back, and it was a young referee, there is only one decision that is going to happen. We felt it was harsh. \u2018First and foremost we hope that George is all right. Nathan has gone looking for him to make sure he is OK, he\u2019s not that type of person.\u2019\n",

Dean Boswell and Stephen John were found dead in their beds the morning after they both attended a party in Pembroke Dock, West Wales. Another friend was hospitalised after falling ill from taking the same substance, believed to be a synthetic psychoactive drug. Police are now investigating the sudden death of Mr Boswell, 36, who was a builder, and his second cousin Mr John, 40, and are awaiting the results of toxicology tests. Death: Dean Boswell, left, and Stephen John, right, died after taking a legal high at a house party . Health officials have warned that legal highs are becoming stronger, leading to a rise in the number of people being hospitalised after taking them. A friend said that the three men were at a party together 10 days ago where several people took legal highs, before they returned to their separate homes. She said: 'There were a group having a good time together on Friday night and it appears Dean and Stephen took some kind of legal high which has ended up killing them. 'It is so tragic as both of them were so full of life and had everything to live for.' Mr Boswell's mother Wynfrai said that she found her son dead in his bedroom on the morning of her 59th birthday, and vowed to use his funeral this week to alert others to the dangers of drugs. 'Dean wasn't a heavy drug user - he maybe had the odd smoke,' she said. 'I suspect they thought they were invincible. Deadly: Legal highs such as mephedrone, pictured, have grown in popularity in recent years . 'It is too early to speak about all this for both families but the vicar will be saying something about drugs at the funeral. 'Something has to be done about the people who sell drugs and the deaths that are happening in the town. The family was previously struck by tragedy when Mr Boswell's sister died on Valentine's Day a few years ago. In recent years, there has been a huge surge in the number of deaths linked to legal highs. 97 people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009. It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years. In around two-thirds of cases, the post-mortem examination established that the legal high was the direct cause of death. Ministers have already introduced bans on some former legal highs, including mephedrone - known as meow meow - NBOMe and Benzofury. A ban on synthetic stimulant mephedrone came into force across the UK in 2010. The drug is now a Class B substance, along with its associated compounds. The two cousins were said to be very close to one another, and as they were both avid fans of Liverpool FC they will have the club's crest on their coffins at their funerals . A spokesman for Dyfed Powys Police said: 'An investigation is ongoing into the cause of their deaths. Police are awaiting results of a toxicology test in order to establish the cause of death.' The police added:\u00a0'Police in Pembrokeshire are committed to the ongoing fight against substance misuse across the county. Enforcement activities take place regularly, but we also educate people on the risks of substance misuse. 'We want young people in particular to be informed and aware of the serious dangers of substance misuse, and encourage family and friends to look out for them by familiarising themselves with the tell-tale signs of misuse of drugs.' Anti-drug groups say that legal highs - officially known as New Psychoactive Substances - are getting stronger and more readily available. Josie Smith, from the Welsh drug testing agency Wedinos, said: 'What we have found in the past year is an increase in the strength of NPS drugs. 'They have addiction potential far higher than some of the controlled substances.' Doctors are also concerned by the effects of the drugs bought online and in so-called 'head shops'. Julia Lewis, of the Aneurin Bevan Health Board in South Wales, said: 'We are seeing increasing numbers of people going into mental health units with acute psychotic episodes after having taken some of these legal substances. 'We are hearing of quite young people having heart attacks - I treated one 17-year-old boy who'd had a small heart attack on one of these substances.' Danger: Owain Vaughan, 14, pictured with mother Jenny, was hospitalised thanks to a legal high . Three schoolboys from Glynneath in South Wales have been hospitalised after they took a legal high which they had bought over the counter. Owain Vaughan, 14, took the drug with friends and was rushed to hospital after suffering severe fits, low blood pressure, burst blood vessels in his face and violent nausea. When he came round, he insisted he had never taken drugs before but said he assumed the substance would be safe because it was legal. His mother Jennie said: 'I'm so embarrassed but people need to be aware. My boy was given a legal high and ended up in A&E. 'I had no sleep for over 24 hours and thought my baby was going to die. I don't want any other child or parent to go through this.' After his ordeal, Owain posted a message on Facebook warning his friends not to dabble with drugs which could turn out to be unsafe or even deadly.\n",

Ultimately, McCoy did get on the winner\u2019s podium but that was to present the trophy to the team behind Next Sensation, winner of the concluding AP McCoy Grand Annual Chase. Not surprisingly, the Michael Scudamore-trained Next Sensation, ridden by Scudamore\u2019s brother Tom, had received a quieter reception than McCoy\u2019s fourth-placed Ned Buntline. A crowd close to 70,000 had cheered and chanted his name as McCoy brought his mount down the famous walkway off the track. There were not many who had sneaked away to beat the traffic. And while they did not get the result they wanted, McCoy did at least break the habit of a lifetime for them. The man for whom winning is the only thing that matters, punched and waved the air. The defeat of Carlingford Lough, however, came as no surprise. After the Gold Cup, McCoy conceded he had anticipated his fate on arriving at the track when overnight rain was turning the ground soft. Tony McCoy and Ned Buntline gave it a good go on the 19-time champion jockey's final Festival ride . An emotional McCoy after his last ever ride at the Cheltenham Festival . The big screen at Cheltenham displayed a tribute to the retiring jockey . \u2018I knew when I got here this morning that it was always going to be against him,\u2019 McCoy said. \u2018He is a horse who likes good ground and it was always going to be too much of a drag. \u2018For a horse who is slow he has a little bit of a kick at the end but not when the ground is like that.\u2019 McCoy then paid generous tribute to the winning team. \u2018The Bradstocks have done a wonderful job,\u2019 he said. \u2018They have proved that if they get the horse, they can do the job. To win the Gold Cup with a novice is a fantastic performance.\u2019 For the uninitiated, a novice is a horse that had not won in a particular category \u2014 hurdles or steeplechase \u2014 before the start of the season. Even if it does then win a race, the horse remains a novice until the end of that season. Animals who record their first win in March or April may still contest novice events until October 31. As for McCoy, it was just one of those days as he failed to add to Thursday\u2019s Ryanair Chase victory on Uxizandre, who goes down as his 31st and final Festival victory. Hargam, rated one of his best chances of the week but another wrong-footed by the rain, swung for home with a chance in the Triumph Hurdle but finished third behind Nicky Henderson stablemates Peace And Co and Top Notch. McCoy was presented with a photo album of his Cheltenham career after his final fling at the Festival . McCoy, in the middle of the picture, walks out of the Cheltenham weighing room for the last time . Strongly-backed Princely Conn was staying on when badly hampered and slipped back to 13th in the County Hurdle while Fletchers Flyer, McCoy\u2019s mount in the Albert Bartlett Novices\u2019 Hurdle, was a non-runner. And just when McCoy wanted the racing gods to smile on him, they frowned instead as Ned Buntline was hindered by a faller four out. McCoy said: \u2018All through the week people have been amazing and I appreciate it. I have always tried to look forward but now I am going to have to look backwards as I have nothing to look forward to.\u2019 Five rides at Uttoxeter this afternoon, including the favourite in the Midlands National, will be on his mind this morning but his admiration for Coneygree and his team was well deserved. The 7-1 shot was in front at the first fence and never headed in a display of controlled jumping at speed that no rival could live with. Five of the 16 starters were pulled up, including 2013 winner Bobs Worth and last year\u2019s victor Lord Windermere, who started at the back and never looked like defending his title. Last year\u2019s runner-up On His Own was Coneygree\u2019s closest pursuer for most of the race but faded to fourth. One by one they cracked as Coneygree saw off Djakadam and Road To Riches with the equine equivalent of a McCoy-type performance.\n",

'I used to have so many body hang ups, hated my size and wanted to change myself. 'But as I get older I'm realising it's all about self love and treating your body like the temple it is.' The winner of the competition - chosen by online vote - will win an all-expenses Mediterranean holiday with \u00a31,000 in spending money as well as a one-year modelling contract for the firm.

A police source said the photos online were 'causing a sensation' among officers . 'Star In A Bra seemed to cement that confidence and it really shines through now in all I do.' A spokesman for Curvy Kate said the online vote for a winner from the top 10 would take place at the end of the month, adding: 'This year we're having a worldwide curve celebration. 'We make beautiful lingerie and swimwear that looks amazing on a wide range of figures and sizes, so we want models who represent this. 'We're looking for our next Star in a Bra queen - all of the models you see in our brochures are discovered through our annual Star in a Bra competition and they're chosen by you. 'With the public outcry for the use of more realistic images in the media, Star in a Bra champions the use of relatable role models and promotes a positive approach to body image.

The Scots were despatched with embarrassing ease at Murrayfield during the 2014 Six Nations, the 20-0 defeat leading to some commentators questioning whether they should remain part of the Championship. Now, having lost their first three matches of this year\u2019s tournament, Vern Cotter\u2019s men head to Twickenham once again in dire straits and with a winless record at \u2018HQ\u2019 that stretches back to 1983. Scotland tighthead Euan Murray throws a pass during his side's captain's run at Twickenham on Friday . Scotland hooker Ross Ford leads a passing drill during Scotland's final preparations for Saturday's game . Edinburgh's Greig Tonks will provide three-quarter from the bench at England HQ . However, Scotland centre Scott, recalled to the starting XV at the expense of the luckless Alex Dunbar, believes that the visitors can upset the odds - but only if they avoid the mistakes made 12 months ago. \u2018The England game last year was horrible to look back on,\u2019 he said. \u2018It was a terrible overall performance. \u2018I remember the boys being so fired up for that game and it is funny how we just completely went to pieces. \u2018We didn\u2019t play rugby at all back then so this weekend it\u2019s about drip feeding that passion we felt last year but channelled in the wrong way. Last year, we had boys with tears in their eyes in the dressing room before the game. \u2018It was an emotionally charged affair, but it\u2019s a professional sport and it should all be about cool heads. \u2018There\u2019s a big focus for us on keeping cool this week because there\u2019s a fine line between being like that and letting your emotions run away with you and we certainly crossed it in the wrong way last year. Vern Cotter's squad gather for a team huddle at the end of the session at Twickenham . \u2018I took that defeat really badly as it was probably the worst one of my career. \u2018I remember the embarrassment of it all and that defeat has been used as motivation this week. There was a lack of structure to our attack, we were all over the place in parts. There was poor execution of kicks, poor decision-making, it just looked really disjointed. \u2018We have watched clips this week and we know there are one or two points to prove.\u2019 Scott also revealed that, should the Scots pull off what some would consider the impossible, they would dedicate the victory to stricken team-mate Dunbar. The Edinburgh centre admitted he was \u2018devastated\u2019 for his close friend after Dunbar sustained a knee injury that could rule him out of this year\u2019s Rugby World Cup. \u2018I am sure it will be tough for Alex to watch knowing that he was meant to be playing in the match today,\u2019 said Scott. \u2018It would be a massive get well soon present for him from us if we can bring home the Calcutta Cup for him and that is what we will be trying to do. \u2018There is a feeling in the camp of: \u201cLet\u2019s do this for him\u201d. In professional rugby, guys do get long-term injuries but ones like Alex\u2019s does bring us closer together in the sense we want to do well for him. Scotland fly half Finn Russell (left) and full back Stuart Hogg work on their kicking on Friday . \u2018I was pretty close to Alex when he got injured on Thursday morning and it was the most innocuous thing as there was nobody near him when he pulled up. \u2018The way it happened, he must have played it over in his head 100 times as he was extremely unlucky. \u2018I am devastated for him and sent him a message straight after training saying I hoped it was good news but, unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t. \u2018In this period leading up to the World Cup you really don\u2019t want anyone to get any long-term injuries. There is a chance he can still make the tournament so I am praying for him to make a speedy recovery.\u2019 Hogg (second left) is all smiles ahead of Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash in London . Scott, for all his honest sympathy and concern over Dunbar, knows his misfortune has given him a chance of making the No 12 jersey his own from now until the World Cup. \u2018It has been a tough few months for me personally, not being selected and being injured,\u2019 he continued. \u2018Now I have a chance to start for Scotland and want to do my talking on the pitch. \u2018I had a great run of starting a lot of games for Scotland earlier in my international career and I was very lucky to do that. Then got a bad injury and it took me a while to get back to where I was. Now, I feel I am back to where I was and am ready to fill Alex\u2019s boots and do him proud. \u2018I am pleased to be starting rather than being on the bench as most rugby players will say it is harder to come off the bench. Most games I have played professionally I have started, which is the way I like it. \u2018If you are on the bench you don\u2019t know if you are coming on in minute one or minute 79 so you are constantly on edge. At least this time out I can hit the pace of the game straight away.\u2019\n",

But a photo of her finish has caused a sensation online, thanks to a police officer who kept her going when she was about to give up. The race in Louisville, Kentucky, was another milestone for Ford, who has lost 217 pounds in her quest to live a healthier life for her children. According to CNN affiliate WAVE-TV, Ford trained for months for the event. But around mile 5, breathing became a challenge. \"I messed up and forgot to eat this morning,\" she wrote on her Facebook page, adding that she was still recovering from a bout of pneumonia. As she struggled to finish, to move forward and to catch her breath, her son Terrance stepped in to offer a supporting hand. Emergency medical service crew weren't far behind, just in case. But Ford wouldn't let breathing problems or an empty stomach hold her back. Louisville police Lt. Aubrey Gregory was impressed. \"The EMS guys got out to check on her, and she said I'm not stopping, I'm not stopping,\" Gregory told WAVE-TV. \"So I said I'm not going to let her stop, we're going to do this together. So I got out and I grabbed her hand. I had to meet this inspirational woman.\" Flanked by her son and the lieutenant, Ford walked the remaining 1.2 miles. Photos show her face twisted in a grimace, Lt. Gregory leaning toward her, talking about health, trying to keep her mind off the pain. \"I almost had a slip up with my breathing,\" Ford wrote on Facebook, \"but a police officer by the name of Mr Gregory got out and took my hand to finish the race with my baby and I and WE MADE IT!!!\" Ford's story has racked up well north of 1 million likes on Facebook. In the comments, people shared notes of encouragement and congratulations for Ford. \"As someone who has also lost 200lbs...I know how HARD you worked for this wonderful moment,\" wrote Jennifer Bruce. Many praised the officer for helping and for caring. \"Now that's community service,\" opined one commenter. Others noted that this is a welcome good news story, especially after a spate of high profile police shootings. Ford's son Terrance expressed a similar sentiment to WAVE-TV, saying \"with all the stuff that's going on with police it's nice to know there good people out there.\" Terrance also said his mother's tenacity \"makes me push harder to do the things I want to do in life.\" As for Lt.

        "input": "Host commentator . That's it from Sportsmail's live El Clasico Q&A. Thanks for following and thank you for some brilliant questions. Until next time! Pete Jenson: A lot depends on who makes a move and on how much they are willing to pay. If a club bid \u00a390million for Bale or \u00a365m for Ronaldo (bearing in mind he is 30), I think Real Madrid would consider it. Ronaldo because it would make economic sense and Bale because it would not be unpopular with Real supporters. They definitely won\u2019t sell both! And quite possible both will stay but it will be an interesting summer, especially if they win nothing and supporters are demanding an overhaul of the squad. Pete Jenson: The better players were in playing the Clasico and yet the best goal of the six that were scored came at Anfield from Juan Mata. I enjoyed both games. There were away fans in the Liverpool vs Manchester United game \u2013 that is something that is always missing from a Clasico. Pete Jenson: Fair assessment, yes. Ronaldo was as motivated as I\u2019ve seen him recently. Perhaps a week of talk about Messi being the greatest ever had contributed to that. He also helped set the tone of the first half with the at run at Alves as soon as he got the ball. He took his goal well and was one of those Madrid players who didn\u2019t deserve to be on the losing side. Messi had a strange night. He seemed to be staying out on Marcelo\u2019s wing because that is where there is usually plenty of space. But Madrid pressed so well he didn\u2019t see a great deal of the ball. He certainly didn\u2019t run the game as he did against Manchester City. But I agree once Modric and Kroos had faded in the second half he began to impose himself. Pete Jenson: It was the 42nd Clasico he\u2019d played some part in \u2013 no Barcelona player has played in more. What he always contributed was calm. By Spanish football standards Bar\u00e7a vs Madrid games are usually very frenetic and yet he always seemed to have an extra second of time and a extra yard of space. He\u2019ll come back to this fixture as Barcelona manager one day, you can count on it. Pete Jenson: The most shameful thing about it is that we have seen incidents in recent years of players collapsing on the pitch and sometimes even dying. So to feign serious injury is pretty unforgivable. I don\u2019t mind the roll-over-ten-times merchants so much because it has a certain comic value, but the hand over the face when actually you\u2019ve just been hit in the shoulder is very tiresome. Pete Jenson: He was poor in the first half and it was his miss just before Ronaldo equalised that made the game such a contest. He improved in the second half but I think sometimes the more frenetic and physical the game the more he tends to just get bumped around the pitch. You have to give him some credit for that double-breasted red leather blazer he was wearing after the game though. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very happy for several reasons. Firstly he is not really sure why scoring the winning goals in the Copa del Rey final and the Champions League final last season does not seem to have earned him any respect from the club\u2019s supporters \u2013 he gets whistled in at the Bernabeu if he puts one pass out of place and so-called \u2018fans\u2019 have tried to kick out at his car when he drives away from the training ground (it happened again in the early hours of this morning). He is also not too sure why when he was such a success as an out-and-out forward last season he is being asked to do a more defensive job this year. CLICK HERE to read the full story as angry Madrid fan attacks Bale's car . Pete Jenson: He wants to come back to England, no doubt about it. Arsenal would give him all the job security he has missed out on at first Chelsea and now Madrid. Paul Clement would I\u2019m sure go with him back to his home city and Arsenal \u2013 who seem terrified that if they move Wenger on they will stop qualifying for the Champions League \u2013 would have a coach who has won the competition three times. It all sounds perfect, I don\u2019t know why the wheels have not already been set in motion! Pete Jenson: In one sense he doesn\u2019t have to adapt that much because this Barca does not play like the old Pep Guardiola, Barca. We saw that last night with their goals coming from a long ball and a set play. He has also come through the Ajax school, and Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Liverpool don\u2019t exactly play like Harry Basset\u2019s Wimbledon so a fast passing game is not exactly alien to him. It\u2019s more about striking that fine balance between being selfish when the goal is gaping, and not ignoring his pal Messi when he is in a better position than him. Pete Jenson: Immense. Pique has developed a reputation over the last couple of years for being more focussed on his poker hand or his online games business than his football but he has blown away those theories this season. The greatest compliment paid to him last night was that he played like Carles Puyol. He will always be very different from his old central defensive partner but in terms of concentration and throwing himself in front of the ball when he had too it was a real leader\u2019s performance. Pete Jenson: No one stays in the job very long. They had 25 managers in the 25 years that Sir Alex Ferguson was at Old Trafford and old habits die hard. It\u2019s incredible to think that Ancelotti hasn\u2019t been immortalised by adoring supporters after winning \u2018La Decima\u2019 but he hasn\u2019t and unless they win the league or the Champions League this season there will be a change. Zidane will almost definitely manage Real Madrid one day. It could happen this summer but that will be down to him deciding if he is ready as much as anyone else putting him in charge. Pete Jenson: Bale is at his best when he is given free reign going forward. Last night in the first half he was asked to play wide right in a four-man midfield as opposed to up-top in the three of a 4-3-3. He put a decent shift in but if he\u2019s working back he can\u2019t also be on Jordi Alba\u2019s shoulder waiting to pull away. This is why I still think from a purely football perspective he could still be tempted by a move to a club where he would be the star striker with fewer defensive responsibilities. He also faded last night because the team did \u2013 Modric and Kroos both ran out of juice in the second half and the team suffered. Pete Jenson: It\u2019s been a long time since I can remember seeing him dive. I think the Premier League cured him of that. And he is also alongside Messi now, and Messi very rarely dives. But he does lay it on a bit thick sometimes when he goes down I agree. Look at it from his perspective though, he is up against Ramos and Pepe, both are clattering him at every opportunity for 90 minutes; and Pepe enjoys the dramatics too. So if a little exaggeration gets him one extra favourable decision from the referee then he sees it as fair game. Pete Jenson: It was tough for him at first because he could no longer be as single-minded as he was at Liverpool. In the Premier League he knew that when the ball came to him his responsibility was to just to take the quickest route to goal. At Barcelona he\u2019s got Neymar on one side, Messi on the other and he tried too hard at first to be unselfish. But Barcelona need him to be selfish sometimes and last night when Alves played the ball forward there was only one thing on his mind. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll score as many goals as he did at Liverpool in one season \u2013 but he will score more important ones.

        "input": "A woman who was driven to lose weight after her ex-boyfriend began dating a slimmer colleague has lost 10 stone - and won back her ex. Stephanie Nicks, 28, from Chesham, Buckinghamshire, used to weigh a hefty 20st 9lb, gorging on sausage and bacon sandwiches for breakfast, and family sized Doritos as a late-night snack. But she was left horrified when she split up with her boyfriend, care worker Larry Nicks, 30, and he began dating a slimmer woman. Scroll down for video . Stephanie Nicks, 28, went from 20st 9lb to 11st 1lb and had shed around 10 stone in total . 28-year-old Stephanie Nicks went on to lose an astonishing 10 stone and went down nine dress sizes . Determined to win him back, the size 28 account manager vowed to ditch the flab and has since shed an astonishing 10st. Stephanie is now a slinky size 10, and the couple, having reunited, are happily married. Stephanie said: 'My diet was terrible. I'd scoff on kebabs and McDonald's takeaways, followed by crisps and chocolate. 'Over the years, my weight ballooned. I couldn't find any clothes to fit me and I was really self-conscious. 'Larry had always told me that he loved me no matter how big I was, but then we split and he started dating someone much smaller. That's when I realised just how much I had let myself go. 'I knew I couldn't keep eating myself into an early grave.' Stephanie had struggled with her weight since the age of 11, when she started comfort-eating after her best friend moved to a different school. She began dating Larry at the age of 16, and the two became engaged in 2007 after he proposed on a romantic trip to Kenya for her 21st birthday. Stephanie described Larry dating a slimmer woman after their break-up as 'an extra kick in the teeth'. After joining Weight Watchers, she hit her target a month before the wedding and walked down the aisle at 11st . Stephanie was overjoyed at the weight loss but embarrassed by the loose skin on her stomach . After years of hiding her body after losing weight, Stephanie can now wear the clothes she's always dreamed . But years of overeating saw her weight soar to 20st 9lb and Stephanie's confidence plummeted. After a series of arguments, the couple split in late 2008. Shortly afterwards, Larry began dating another woman. Stephanie said: 'It was bad enough that he'd started seeing someone else, but knowing she was skinnier than me was an extra kick in the teeth. 'I have to admit that I was a bit jealous, and it made me think more about the way I looked.' The couple reconciled soon after and Stephanie used her new sense of determination to join her local Weight Watchers group. She said: 'I wanted to keep Larry interested, but more importantly improve my health and confidence.' Throwing out all of the junk food from her cupboards, she filled her fridge with fresh fruit and vegetables. And instead of driving, she began to walk everywhere. Within weeks, she began to notice a difference and the couple excitedly set a date for their wedding. After Stephanie and Larry got engaged, she saw her weight soar to 20st 9lb and her confidence plummet . The 28-year-old, pictured before her weight loss, had struggled with her size since the age of 11 and lived on a diet of kebabs and McDonald's takeaways . More ambitious than ever, Stephanie also picked out her wedding dress. The only catch was that it was a size 10 - nine dresses smaller than her size at the time. Stephanie said: 'It was a challenge, but it was all the motivation I needed to have the wedding of my dreams. 'As the big day approached, I became more and more nervous about fitting into my dress. 'But I kept up the healthy eating and exercise - there was no way I was going to be a fat bride.' Stephanie hit her target weight a month before the wedding and walked down the aisle at 11st 1lb and a size 10 in September 2012. But under her dress, she was hiding an embarrassing secret: a huge sack of loose skin on her stomach. Unable to flaunt her slinky new figure in fitted dresses and skinny jeans, Stephanie instead resorted to tucking her belly into leggings and oversized hoodies. Stephanie said: 'It was hideous. I'd worked really hard for my body, but I had to hide it away by dressing like an old lady. Stephanie, pictured with her mum at her wedding, hit her target weight a month before she tied the knot . 'As well as being unsightly, my jelly belly caused itchy sores and even got in the way in the bedroom. 'In fact I hated it so much, I nicknamed it 'Flabby Abby'!' After two years of hiding her body, Stephanie spoke to her GP and he referred her to a surgeon, who granted Stephanie an operation to remove the skin on the NHS in October 2014. Stephanie said: 'The day of the operation was nerve-wracking, so to calm me down, Larry and I took bets on how much Flabby Abby would weigh. 'Both of us got a shock when doctors told us she'd weighed in at an impressive 11lb.' BREAKFAST: Sausage and bacon sandwich, two hash browns, lashings of ketchup . LUNCH: Cheese and coleslaw sandwich . DINNER: Kebab, followed by a McDonald's . SNACKS: Family-sized Doritos, chocolate . BREAKFAST: Weetabix, soya milk, banana . LUNCH: Chicken and feta salad with fat-free dressing . DINNER: Chicken wrap . SNACKS: Apples, grapes . Over the next few weeks, Stephanie's stomach continued to heal and she could finally wear the clothes she had always dreamed of. Now a confident size 10 at 10st 9lb, Stephanie says she has never felt better. She said: 'I am so much more confident now. Larry even jokes that he's got a new wife because I'm so much more outgoing. 'Looking back, I can't believe I ever let my weight get so out of control. I'll never go back to being that big again.'\n",

        "input": "(CNN)French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has a history of fainting, said he is now \"feeling well\" after collapsing during Swansea's 3-2 loss at Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was \"fine,\" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. \"I wanted to reassure you concerning my health,\" Gomis told the website. \"It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. \"I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. \"I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.\" Gomis had similar fainting spells in France, which prompted the president of his former club, Jean-Michel Aulas of Lyon, to tell French television in 2009: \"We can't not be worried, it scares you each time.\" Swansea ran tests on Gomis, said Monk, prior to signing him on a free transfer last July. \"He just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems,\" Monk said in a televised interview on Sky. \"It's been part of his life. We were well aware of that when we signed him. He's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. \"It's no problems whatsoever. It's not as serious as it looks.\" Gomis has scored two league goals for Swansea this season, mostly in a backup role. He became the Welsh side's top striker when Wilfried Bony signed with Manchester City in January. Almost exactly three years ago at White Hart Lane, then Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest. He was near death, according to Bolton, but survived after being treated at the London Chest Hospital. He subsequently retired. Other footballers, including Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe in 2003 and Spanish international Antonio Puerta in 2007, didn't survive after collapsing on the pitch.\n",

Van Gaal appears to have made a lasting impression on the aforementioned trio having managed Xavi and Iniesta at Barcelona during his two spells at the Nou Camp and Seedorf during his six-year stint as Ajax boss in the 1990s. Xavi, Iniesta and Seedorf - speaking exclusively to MUTV in an interview which will be screened on Monday night - have lauded Van Gaal's philosophy. Clarence Seedorf is among a host of players who have heaped praise on Man United boss Louis van Gaal . Van Gaal managed fellow countryman Seedorf during his time at Dutch outfit Ajax in the 1990s . 'For sure he is a coach who knows how to pass on his philosophy to his teams,' said Seedorf. 'And I think what you have seen that with the Ajax spirit when I played there - that's Van Gaal. 'Instead of buying many players you can always fill your first team with your own players who know the club culture, who know the club tactics and have lived for so long that everything for them is natural. 'He is a great coach and his record speaks for itself.' Xavi, who was given his Barcelona debut by Van Gaal back in 1998, and club team-mate Iniesta echoed Seedorf's comments regarding the Dutch tactician. 'Well my personal experience with him was great,' said Xavi. 'He gave me the opportunity to join the first team and he gave me a lot of confidence the whole time. 'I worked with him and he really put his faith in me. He pushed me into the first team at 17 and helped me so much through that difficult journey. Van Gaal (centre, pictured with a young Seedorf in July 1993) managed Ajax between 1991 and 1997 . Barcelona midfielder Xavi has also lauded Van Gaal for promoting him into the Catalan giants' first team . Andres Iniesta has thanked the Manchester United boss for helping him make an 'important step' in his career . 'In my opinion he didn't get the credit he deserved at Barcelona. He had very clear ideas and was very methodical. He was a coach who was ahead of his time.' Iniesta added: 'I was 17 years of age and delighted to be in the first team, and he gave me that opportunity. I knew that he had always done tremendous work with the young players. 'I was excited to work with him and take such an important step in my career. He's hard working, honest, sincere. Above all, he's a hugely successful manager who's done great things in the game.'

        "input": "Nigel Farage used to claim he wanted to move away from the idea Ukip was a one-man band which relied on his own personal profile. But at the launch of his party's pledge card today, he was photographed in front of no fewer than seven images of himself. Amid a media scrum, Mr Farage used the event to boast that Ukip is 'quite reflective of what modern Britain is', as he called to leave the EU, control borders, spending \u00a33billion more on the NHS, cut foreign aid spending and scrap income tax for the minimum wage. Nigel Farage today launched Ukip's election pledge card, surrounded by no fewer than seven photos of himself . Mr Farage used the event in central London to boast that Ukip is 'quite reflective of what modern Britain is' Ukip hopes to use the election to make a major breakthrough into the Commons, securing enough seats to hold the balance of power in the event of a hung Parliament. Mr Farage said a strong showing for Ukip at May's election could boost the calls for electoral reform, which in turn could make his eurosceptics a 'big party in British politics'. He said: 'I've always thought there should be election reform but that is frankly irrelevant in the next 38 days. 'Yes, this is very hard for us because you find good Ukip support in Labour constituencies and in Conservative constituencies. 'Yes, that's a challenge but what we have to do is to get over the line in enough seats in this General Election campaign and then you'll see how many seats we've actually come second in, and you'll realise as part of a longer-term strategy this really could become a big party in British politics.' Mr Farage was mobbed by photographers, camera people and journalists as he arrived in Smith Square in central London to unveil the poster truck. He was hidden by the media scrum for the duration of the press conference and had to fight his way into his car as he left. Mr Farage was mobbed by photographers, camera people and journalists as he arrived in Smith Square in central London to unveil the poster truck . Earlier Mr Farage played down a run of opinion polls which suggest his support is on the wane, insisting his party is 'more in tune' with the British public. Although the posters include a pledge to control the UK's borders, the word immigration does not feature. The leader was joined by Ukip MP Mark Reckless and other senior Ukip figures, each other them holding an over-sized pledge card in front of the billboard. But Clacton MP Douglas Carswell, who defected from the Tories last year, did not attend the event as he was campaigning in his constituency. Last year Mr Farage warned that people would not vote for Ukip unless he broadened its appeal beyond his own profile. 'I don't think people will vote for us in a general election in big numbers if they think it's a one-man band. I intend to change that over the summer,' he said in May 2014. But Mr Farage today brushed aside questions about the use of his photograph on the card. He said: 'The thing about Ukip is we have become the most eclectic, diverse political party. 'We've got all shades of opinion, we've got people from the left, people from the right, people of all ages, all classes, all races. 'We are quite reflective I think now as a party of what modern Britain is.' Mr Farage insisted that smaller parties will have major influence in an election which no party will win outright . Responding to Ukip's pledge card, a Liberal Democrat spokesman said:\u00a0'Ukip's pledge card should instead be a P45 for each of three million people whose jobs benefit from our membership of the EU.' The latest ComRes poll for the Daily Mail puts\u00a0Ukip on 12 per cent, well down on last year's peak of 19 per cent. Speaking this morning Mr Farage insisted that smaller parties will have major influence in an election which no party will win outright. He vowed to use any influence he can to ensure a referendum on leaving the EU happens this year. The Ukip leader - who will later kick off his party's campaign by announcing its key policies - told ITV1's Good Morning Britain: 'I'm up for it. 'We have got massive public support for our views on proper immigration controls and the need for an Australian-style points system. As we have shown before, we have come from behind in many elections to win in the past. 'We are going to win a good number of seats in Westminster, but with the best will in the world, I am not going to be Prime Minister.' He added: 'I'm a straight-talking person, I'm honest - Ukip are not going to win the general election. But you know what? No-one is going to win the general election. There will be nobody with a clear majority. 'The question is what parties will have enough power to coalesce around the other parties?' He said David Cameron had never wanted to hold a referendum on Britain's EU membership, and had been 'forced into' his vow to stage a poll by the end of 2017. 'Our job in the next Parliament would be to hold his feet to the fire, to make sure that the referendum is not a stitch-up,' he said. 'I don't want this to be kicked into the long grass until the end of 2017. I think it should be before the end of this year.' Mr Farage acknowledged that Ukip had lost ground in the polls over the last few months, but insisted it remained 'more in tune' with the British public on key issues than the mainstream Westminster parties. 'We have dipped a little bit over the last two months, but not markedly,' he said. 'What we have just passed through is the phoney war. The real battle starts today.' Mr Farage acknowledged that Ukip had been 'hurt' by bad publicity including a councillor who made racist comments . Mr Farage acknowledged that Ukip had been 'hurt' by publicity over supporters such as Thanet councillor Rozanne Duncan, who was expelled from the party after saying she had 'a problem with people with negroid features'. But he insisted: 'We are through all of that. What we have now got to talk about is an election campaign in which the biggest issue in voters' minds is the impact of immigration on public services and on people's incomes ...

        "input": "(CNN)A chiseled boxer's Instagram feed shows him making constant references to the Bible and enjoying gospel singing with his wife. Another features his formidable opponent counting stacks of money, hanging out in strip clubs, and flashing diamond watches and Ferraris. Welcome to the world of boxing promotion, circa 2015. American Floyd Mayweather and Filipino Manny Pacquiao are set to officially announce their heavily anticipated boxing match at a press conference in Los Angeles Wednesday. With the combined purse for the May 2 bout in Las Vegas reported to touch $300 million pending viewership numbers, the incentives to self-promote could not be higher. \"Nowadays you have to be on social media to launch the fight and to build hype,\" says boxing promoter Nisse Sauerland, CEO of Team Sauerland. \"It couldn't be done without it.\" Thirty-eight year old Mayweather (47-0, 26 knockouts), who favors the moniker \"The Money Man\" or \"TBE\" (The Best Ever), boasts nearly five million Instagram followers, 5.65 million followers on Twitter and 9.2 million Facebook likes. He famously confirmed the fight via Shots, a photo sharing social media application that he's invested in, and displays links to his clothing brand, The Money Team, on all his accounts. Along with professing to the be the best fighter of all time, he could also stake a claim to be one of the greatest social media users in sports. \"I think they're both playing their roles,\" says Sauerland, who promotes over 45 boxers. \"You've got the bad guy and the good guy, really. You've got the guy who throws the money around (Mayweather), that's his image, and Pacquiao, he's the hope of a nation.\" Although Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 knockouts) also sports millions of followers, his social media numbers lag behind that of his opponent. The 36-year-old Filipino counts 1.7 million followers on Twitter and just 647,000 on Instagram, although his popularity on Facebook is much closer, with 6.3 million page likes. Has this disparity had an impact on Pacquiao's share of the fight's heady purse, which is reported to be split 60/40 in favor of Mayweather? \"If you have five million Twitter followers it does give you power in negotiation, because it reflects popularity, \" says Sauerland. \"But Mayweather needs Pacquiao too; you need a storyline to make a good fight ... (Pacquiao) is the route to make it the biggest purse in history.\" The disparity is probably due to Pacquiao's less flashy posts. Without exception, they show him in training, in church, or with family -- always with a nod to Jesus in the input -- as well as his nationality, says sports media consultant Daniel McLaren and Cast Digital chief executive officer. \"Manny is a little bit more of a private person; he's not going to be as outspoken and give away as much, so he's always going to have a smaller following,\" he says, while noting that Instagram is less popular outside of North America and Europe. Pacquiao's followers in his home country are more likely to track his moves on Facebook and Twitter, adds McLaren. Either way, both fighters are likely to experience a surge in followers. \"If the only place you can find out what's happening behind the scenes in the lead-up to the fight is via their social media feeds, you're going to follow them,\" McLaren says. \"So I think they will see quite a big increase in followers and the amount of mentions they're getting as the fight gets closer.\" Athletes who participate in individual sports are more inclined to be active on social media, says McLaren, because they don't receive regular salaries, and product endorsements can be a much larger portion of their income. \"A boxer or a golfer or a tennis player has to use it as a commercial platform or a brand building platform,\" he says. \"If you have the choice between a different number of athletes to sponsor, and one has a million Instagram followers while the other doesn't go on social media, then it's a no-brainer.\" Sauerland agrees. \"Every fighter nowadays should be on social media, and if they're not, then they're not doing a good enough job at promoting themselves,\" he says. \"It doesn't matter who you are, whether you're a club fighter or a superstar.\" \"It'll be an interesting fight,\" adds McLaren, \"just because they are so different.\"\n",

        "input": "Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN)A former lawyer for the doctor who helped the CIA look for Osama bin Laden has been shot dead in northwest Pakistan, police said. Unidentified gunmen attacked the lawyer, Samiullah Afridi, in his car near the city of Peshawar on Tuesday, said Mian Saeed, a police superintendent in Peshawar. Two different militant groups claimed responsibility for the killing. The lawyer had represented Dr. Shakeel Afridi, who was convicted of treason in 2012 by a Pakistani tribal court and is now serving a 23-year prison sentence. The two men are not related. The doctor helped the CIA set up a fake vaccination campaign in an attempt to collect DNA samples from relatives of Bin Laden in an effort to verify his presence in a compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad. The Qaeda leader was killed in a U.S. raid on the compound in May 2011. It was unclear which of the two groups claiming responsibility for the attack was actually behind it. Fahad Marwat, a spokesman for the militant group Jundallah, told CNN that Afridi was on the group's hit list. But Ehsanullah Ehsan, a spokesman for a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, said his group had carried out the assassination because Samiullah Afridi defended the doctor, whom he described as \"a friend\" of bin Laden's killers. CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said Jundallah is \"kind of a splinter group\" of the Pakistani Taliban that's \"been around for a long time.\" \"They're extremely violent,\" he said. \"They've been killing all sorts of religious minorities in Pakistan.\" Last month, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing outside a Shiite mosque in the city of Rawalpindi. Bergen said Dr. Afridi is \"a very unpopular figure in Pakistan\" because of the perception that he was involved in helping find Bin Laden. \"And his lawyer, by extension, would also be seen as an unpopular person because of that perception,\" he said. But Bergen said he didn't think the doctor played a key role in the hunt for Bin Laden. \"The idea was the doctor and his staff would take DNA samples from the Bin Laden kids as part of this 'vaccination program,'\" he said. \"That never happened because the kids never came out.\" Although Dr. Afridi was working for U.S. intelligence, \"the CIA wasn't telling the doctor, you're helping us find bin Laden,\" Bergen said. After the killing of bin Laden, health workers administering polio vaccinations have come to be viewed with suspicion by many Pakistanis. The vaccination teams have repeatedly been targeted by militants. The latest instance came Wednesday when unidentified attackers killed one polio vaccination worker and wounded another in Bajaur agency in northwestern Pakistan, local authorities said. Journalist Zahir Shah reported from Peshawar, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Sophia Saifi and journalist Saleem Mehsud contributed to this report.\n",

Police have emphasized they are still investigating the circumstances surrounding how the babies came to be hidden above the ceiling tiles. But a spokeswoman for\u00a0Concord Family Services, which has owned Smith and Bizzell since 2005, denied they had been hidden in the ceiling. She told the Tribune the babies were stored 'in the morgue', and the home had simply been trying to ensure they had a proper final resting place.

        "input": "(CNN)I was in Florida last year when I got a call asking me to pose for a calendar. What? A calendar? As in Sports Illustrated swimsuit? Victoria's Secret angels? Cover girls. Pinups. Movie stars. Glam. I agreed, and now I am Ms. December. But it isn't quite what you think. The caller on the other end that day was Patti Tripathi. She was an anchor at CNN Headline News at a time when there were few Indian-American women in high-profile media jobs. Tripathi has her own media company now, but more recently she launched a nonprofit called Saris to Suits. She was asking me to help. She began by telling me her story. She was 12 when her family immigrated to the United States. Indian parents often have to save a lot of money to ensure a good marriage for their daughter. Tripathi said that was a big reason why her family left. We spoke about similar experiences as Indian teenagers in America. She was not allowed to go to the prom or wear shorts, except to play tennis. She had an 8 p.m. curfew and her father expected she would be married soon after college. Tripathi felt like a burden. She did everything she could to stand on her own. And she did. My father was not as stern but he had a hard time watching his little girl become \"Americanized.\" I, too, longed to be independent, far more so than was expected of a Bengali girl in the 1970s. At an all-girls convent school in Kolkata, I used to climb up three flights of stairs to reach my classroom. On every landing were oversized portraits of national leaders, most of them Indian. Hundreds of girls in white uniforms made the stampede-like dash up the stairwell. It was impossible to stop but I always looked up when I arrived at Indira Gandhi. There she was, in her trademark white sari and what I thought was a Cruella de Vil slice in her hair. In a nation that valued boys more than girls, I was in awe that we had a female prime minister. Gandhi's political career turned out to be less than stellar, but it was 1971 and I was not yet 9 years old. I wanted to grow up to be just like her. Regal. Smart. And most of all, in control of my destiny. I know so many other Indian girls felt the same. We had dreams. Big dreams. We wanted to be someone, do something rewarding with our lives. Yet for so many girls in India, dreams are vanquished by nightmare life scenarios. They are denied education and married off within months of their first period. I have met women who were abducted and forced into prostitution or lived with physically and mentally abusive men. Those problems are not limited to India or the rest of South Asia. They exist in the immigrant communities in the United States, in which abuse and crimes are underreported because of the stigma that still exists. Women are often ashamed to talk about these things. As an Indian-American journalist, I have told stories with hopes of casting light on the world inhabited by many South Asian women. I have mentored girls in my hometown of Kolkata. And always wondered: What else can I do? Some of that desire stems from my own circumstances in life. As a newborn, I was left on the steps of an orphanage in north Kolkata. It happened to be run by an American missionary, Helen Benedict, who happened to meet my adoptive mother at the Indo-American Society. My mother was honing her English speaking skills there. That was in 1962 and my parents were childless after 10 years of marriage. It's not hard to guess the rest of the story. Instead of growing up in harsh surroundings, I was raised in a professor's house. And, instead of a future that might have been filled with darkness, I faced one that was bright. I had loving parents, attended good schools and traveled around the world. There is not a day that goes by when I don't think about the life I might have led had it not been for that fateful meeting between an American missionary and a Bengali woman pining to become a mother. I shared my story with Tripathi and told her I would help. Tripathi put together Saris to Suits as an empowerment tool. She wanted to raise money to help South Asian women. She also wanted to inspire them, she said. They needed strong role models. They needed to know that they could break out of the molds that were cast for them. She was putting together the 2015 Saris to Suits calendar and wanted to feature South Asian women who had found success in America. They were doctors, lawyers, corporate leaders. One was a weightlifter from Pakistan who struggled with balancing her sport and her Muslim attire. Another was Miss America 2014. I felt honored to be in such fine company. I would be the only journalist in the calendar. It would most certainly be my only chance in life to pretend I was a glamour girl. Some of the women opted to wear saris, the traditional dress of India. Some wore salwar kameez, a long tunic and pants. And some of us were in suits or our work attire. The 2014 calendar, the first one Tripathi published, raised money for various organizations that help South Asian women. One of them was Raksha (which means protection). Based in Atlanta, Raksha provides support for the South Asian community in a number of ways. Most of its clients are women who are dealing with abusive marriages, divorce and issues with their children. Raksha's executive director, Aparna Bhattacharyya, told me why the calendar was important. \"I think it is a reminder that there are women overcoming obstacles and that they have the potential to achieve their own goals for themselves,\" she said. \"I think it is powerful for young South Asian women to see role models that look like themselves -- role models who are making change and following their dreams.\" Her words took me back to my school in Kolkata where I gazed upward at Indira Gandhi's face. In it, I found strength. I am of course, a far cry from the likes of Gandhi, but perhaps I can inspire a teenager out there to be the architect of her future. Maybe a young woman in a sari will be able to put on a suit for the first time in her life. Besides, it's kind of cool to be in a calendar.\n",

        "input": "Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet is too modest to claim the club\u2019s recent revival is partly due to his own impressive personal comeback after he had been dropped earlier in the season by manager Brendan Rodgers. Nevertheless, the facts show that the resurgent Reds go into Saturday's potential top-four decider against Manchester United at Anfield having been beaten only once in 19 domestic games \u2014 a Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Chelsea \u2014 since Mignolet returned to the side on Boxing Day. Prior to that, they had lost four out of seven in the Premier League and had slipped to 10th place. Simon Mignolet has been in impressive form for Liverpool during their resurgence in the Premier League . The Liverpool goalkeeper was dropped from the side earlier in the season after a number of mistakes . The Belgian first found out he had been axed the day before Liverpool faced United in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford in December when United won 3-0. \u2018The gaffer took me into his office to tell me I wouldn\u2019t play against United. It was disappointing and I could have let my head drop, but I decided to be positive to make sure my period on the sidelines was as short as possible,\u2019 said Mignolet. \u2018I trained the next day to make sure I\u2019d be ready in a better way when the opportunity arose.\u2019 His wish came true. When in-favour Brad Jones injured his thigh four matches later at Burnley, Mignolet came on, kept a clean sheet and has not looked back since. A 1-0 win at Swansea City on Monday was his sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home \u2014 the first time that has happened since the days of Bill Shankly. Mignolet makes a fine save from a Gylfi Sigurdsson strike during the win against Swansea on Monday . The Belgian keeper kept his sixth consecutive Premier League away clean sheet against the Swans . Victory against United would lift Liverpool into the top four and they would then be favourites to join Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in next season\u2019s Champions League. The loss at Old Trafford when Rodgers first introduced a three-man defence and played Raheem Sterling up front now appears to be a watershed in the club\u2019s campaign. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to do with me personally,\u2019 said Mignolet. \u2018The gaffer changed the system [to 3-4-3] and since then things have been very organised. We don\u2019t give many chances away and everybody is willing to work for each other. \u2018It\u2019s all about working as a unit. We have dealt well with set-pieces and at the other end, scored goals.\u2019 Having been heavily criticised for key mistakes earlier in the season and dubbed \u2018Dracula\u2019 by former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar for being indecisive with crosses, Mignolet is not taking recent good publicity for granted, even though he was Liverpool\u2019s man-of-the-match at Swansea following crucial saves from Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bafetimbi Gomis. Mignolet, who was dropped earlier in the season, trains alonside Joe Allen and Lazar Markovic . Liverpool have only lost once in 19 domestic matches since Mignolet returned to the side . \u2018As a goalkeeper you\u2019re only remembered for your last game. I know I played half-decent against Swansea but if things turn around against Manchester United on Sunday, no one will mention that,\u2019 he said. \u2018I know how it goes and how football is. You have to accept it, but that is also something positive because there\u2019s always something new around the corner. \u2018The next game is always the biggest one. That\u2019s what we say.\u2019 After last season\u2019s thrilling challenge for the league title, Rodgers reacted bravely when the first half to this campaign did not go according to plan. Liverpool impressed at Old Trafford in December but fell to a 3-0 loss after a David De Gea masterclass . Emre Can has emerged as a key figure in Liverpool's three-man defence in the past few months . Summer signings Mario Balotelli, Lazar Markovic, Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert were sidelined, while club captain Steven Gerrard was allowed to negotiate a deal to join LA Galaxy this summer. Instead, Sterling was used as a centre-forward until Daniel Sturridge\u2019s recent return from injury as Rodgers returned to last season\u2019s quick-passing style. At the back, midfielder Emre Can was asked to be part of a back-three with Martin Skrtel and the restored Lovren. As results improved, Markovic and Lallana were brought back in and the team remain unbeaten in the Premier League in 2015, having taken 33 points from a possible 39. Liverpool have narrowed the gap on United from 10 points to two. They are rediscovering the art of scoring goals while keeping it tight at the back. The Reds haven't tasted defeat in the Premier League since the outing at Old Trafford . \u2018Swansea was an example where we had to grind it out. It was 0-0 at half time and then we came out and put pressure on them high up the field. And we scored out of that [through Jordan Henderson],\u2019 added Mignolet. \u2018I think that\u2019s what we are about. The 3-0 defeat away to Manchester United was a while ago and there\u2019s no point in reflecting too much on what has been. Professional footballers have to adapt to any system. It is more to do with the organisation and how everybody does their job rather than the system itself. \u2018At the moment, the players are all working really hard. If the gaffer points something out, everybody is ready to listen and make sure it gets done. And it is clicking. \u2018There is no point looking over your shoulder [at the past] because what we are thinking about is preparing ourselves the best we can for the Manchester United game.\u2019\n",

Tuesday night's 2-0 win in Monaco was not enough to prevent a last-16 exit as Arsenal lost out on away goals rule following their 3-1 first-leg defeat at the Emirates last month. And Wenger, who has been in the competition for 17 straight seasons, says that his side might even be better away from the top-tier competition in future given their recent trend of exiting almost as soon as the knockout stages have begun. Arsene Wenger had admitted that Arsenal might have a better chance of winning in the Europa League . Wenger's Arsenal side could only find two goals in Monaco on Tuesday, when they needed at least three . After repeated Champions League failure, Wenger has speculated about winning the Europa League in future . The third-placed team in each Champions League group - a fate that Wenger has never suffered - move into the Europa League rather than a total exit from Europe, and the Arsenal boss believes that might be a better silverware opportunity. When asked if these early exits were eating away at him, Wenger replied: 'Yes, but we were eliminated by teams who reached the final. Maybe it would be better not to pass the group phase and play the Europa League than to be eliminated in the last 16. We would have more chances to win a title.' When pressed for clarification, the Arsenal manager insisted this was meant to be a comment about the abrupt and unforgiving nature of the Champions League in its sudden-death phase rather than a serious realignment of ambitions.

The Arsenal boss also told L'Equipe that he thought his team's performance was good but that they left themselves too much to do after a poor showing in London last month.

In January manager Brendan Rodgers said he was hopeful a solution could be found to keep the England international but with Johnson having lost his first-team place in the 3-4-2-1 formation which has been so successful since the turn of the year that now looks less likely.

He has long been linked with a move abroad - he has been free to talk to overseas clubs since January 1 - and the defender admits there have been discussions. Asked about his contract situation with Liverpool Johnson said: 'No talks. At this point I have no idea (where I will be next season). I haven't thought about it.' On his option to explore a move overseas he added: 'There are talks. It would be great for the kids to go abroad but I am not thinking about yet as we have two months left here and I'll think about it after that. 'We will have to wait and see.'

Currently, European Union regulators assume pollen from the crop, which has been manipulated to include a toxin that kills pests, can travel only 20 to 40 metres. However, research suggests that significant amounts of the pollen, which harms butterflies and moths, can be carried up to 4.45 kilometres \u2013 2.7 miles \u2013 on the wind. Watchdogs have launched an investigation into GM corn following a study showing \u2018toxic\u2019 pollen from the plants can travel miles to contaminate the countryside . Critics say that if this is correct the rules must be redrawn to protect the countryside and stop the pollen contaminating conventional and organic farms and food over vast areas. The European Food Safety Authority is now reviewing the approval process for the corn \u2013 known as Bt maize \u2013 following the German study. Its investigation is particularly important because the European Commission is in the final throes of approving a type of GM maize that was assessed under a safety regime that did not take account of the new information. The researchers measured the spread of pollen from maize crops over ten years at hundreds of sites in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They discovered that assumptions that maize pollen is heavy and falls to the ground over a short distance from the plants were spectacularly wrong. The research found the concentration ranged from 23.3million grains of pollen per square metre close to the fields to 2,857 grains at greater distances. Significant amounts of pollen were found more than 2\u00bd miles away. Previous assumptions on pollen dispersal were based on the premise that the air was still, but the German researchers pointed out that these conditions are \u2018practically non-existent\u2019 in the real world. They said some studies suggest that the pollen can be lifted high in the air by strong winds and carried for more than 40 miles. The experts, whose research was published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe, said even small amounts of pollen containing the toxin \u2013 as little as four grains \u2013 will harm or kill sensitive butterflies and moths. The European Food Safety Authority is reviewing the approval process for the corn \u2013 known as Bt maize - following a research study by German academics, while one environmental group called for it to be banned altogether . They concluded that measures would be needed to ensure any GM maize crops are more than half a mile away from sensitive areas of countryside which are home to important populations of butterflies and moths. Mute Schimpf, of Friends of the Earth Europe, said: \u2018The only logical and scientific conclusion is to halt the cultivation of all GM maize in Europe.\u2019 Last month, MPs on the science and technology select committee said the term \u2018GM food\u2019 should be abandoned because it had become a \u2018lightning rod\u2019 for fears about designer crops. Anti-GM groups accused MPs of trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the public.\n",

These pictures show a teenage girl enjoying life in modern Britain before joining ISIS to become a \u2018jihadi bride\u2019. She laughs in the park, shows off vividly painted nails, and poses with the athletics\u2019 squad of her East London school, where she was top of her science class. On Facebook, she writes of going swimming with a friend, loving the music of American rapper Tupac Shakur and enjoying a birthday treat. Few could have predicted what 15-year-old Amira Abase would do next. Two weeks ago, in the middle of half-term, she abruptly walked out of her family\u2019s council home in East London, wearing black jeans and trainers. She caught a bus to Gatwick Airport and flew to Istanbul with two fellow Muslim classmates, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Shamima Begum, 15. Next \u2014 in footage captured by CCTV cameras \u2014 the trio waited in the snow to board another bus to travel to the Turkish border with Syria. There, Islamic State militants were waiting for them. The girls, by now dressed in burkas, were bundled into cars and disappeared to a life where they will have to marry a fighter selected for them, never step foot outside without him, and become a household drone doing chores restricted to women. Intelligence services say they may even be trained to become fighters themselves. Amira is not the first Western girl to join Islamic State. Police said this week that 60 young British women, many of them schoolgirls, have left for Syria. Few, however, have been radicalised so swiftly as Amira Abase. Back in East London, her friends \u2014 many of them non-Muslims \u2014 have given a series of exclusive interviews to explain how she had changed before their eyes. As one 16-year-old girl told me this week: \u2018She was perfectly normal. She talked about having a lip-piercing one day, and listened to pop chart songs. \u2018She was pretty, popular, and a bit of a rebel who saw the funny side of life. I first met her in maths class four years ago. We became best friends.\u2019 Painted nails: Fifteen-year-old Amira, who was born in Ethiopia, larks around with her friends in the park . Born in Ethiopia, Amira moved with her family first to England, and then Germany, before returning here and starting school at Bethnal Green Academy at the age of 11. \u2018When I visited, I found her home was not overpoweringly Islamic,\u2019 her friend added. \u2018We had a family meal cooked by her mother, who did not wear the hijab at home. After eating, Amira and I went out to the park. \u2018She had a BlackBerry phone at 11 or 12, and later an iPhone and computer. She was on them all the time.\u2019 At school, Amira, a Chelsea football fan, shone in debates, once giving a speech on why Muslim women wear the veil. She passed three GCSEs in maths and science early, at age 14. This autumn, she\u2019d planned to study A-level history, maths and biology at the London Academy of Excellence, set up for high-fliers under the free school programme. Her talents did not stop in class. At 13 and 14 she was a star of the school athletics squad, competing across Southern England in the 800 and 1,200 metres. Off to join ISIS: Amira (centre, circled) caught a bus to Gatwick Airport and flew to Istanbul with two fellow Muslim classmates, Kadiza Sultana (left), 16, and Shamima Begum (right), 15. They are pictured at Gatwick . Although she wore the hijab to class, covering her hair in line with Islamic teachings, she abandoned the headgear when she played sport or was with her girl friends. A member of the athletics squad explained: \u2018Amira didn\u2019t make a big thing about her Muslim faith. She came to parties if there was no alcohol, and we\u2019d go shopping for clothes. She was one of us. \u2018She got friendly with a boy she met at athletics. We teased her about standing very close to him, so she joked she was leaning on him for support. Her parents would not have approved of a boyfriend.\u2019 Yet last year Amira was exposed to a parallel world from her non-Muslim friends. While they were going clubbing, meeting boyfriends, and taking foreign holidays together, these Western ways were forbidden to Amira because of her background. She was expected to pray regularly, and was, her friends think, facing an arranged marriage to a man of her family\u2019s choice in the future. Another friend said: \u2018We suspect she joined ISIS because it was exciting thing to do; a way of rebelling. Unlike us, there were not a lot of exciting options open to her.\u2019 Model student: Amira was due to study three A-levels at the London Academy of Excellence this autumn . By the time of her 15th birthday in May last year, Amira had become a \u2018different person\u2019. She cut herself off from her \u2018clique\u2019 of non-Muslim friends, and mixed instead with two other Muslim girls in the same school year group: Kadiza and Shamima, who, of course, are now with her in Syria. Her old school friends said they were shocked when she sent them a video link claiming that Israelis were deliberately burning Palestinian children. \u2018It was horrifying because it showed babies being hurt. I deleted it,\u2019 admitted one. Amira and her two Muslim friends were overheard using derogatory terms for non-Muslim girls, calling one a \u2018slag\u2019 and others \u2018kafir\u2019 (an Arabic term for non-believer). \u2018She was getting into religion and Middle Eastern affairs seriously. She hung around with these two Muslim girls all the time,\u2019 said her friend. We now know that one of those girls, Shamima, used her Twitter account to contact a former medical student, 20-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, who left Glasgow last year to join ISIS and marry a jihadist. Bayrampasa bus station: In footage captured by CCTV cameras, the trio (above) waited to board a bus to travel to the Turkish border with Syria. There, Islamic State militants were waiting for them . Shamima was following 70 other ISIS terrorists on Twitter, too, many of whom, like Aqsa, used a messaging programme called Surespot. This encrypts messages to avoid interception by intelligence authorities. When messages are deleted by ISIS recruiters, they are automatically erased from the phones of those who have received them. Friends suspect that Amira and the other girls were in touch with Aqsa and other ISIS recruiters via their mobile phones or home computers since before Christmas. \u2018Amira is portrayed by police and the school as na\u00efve and vulnerable,\u2019 said one of her friends. \u2018But she was savvy and intelligent, and used to getting what she wanted.\u2019 Police were called to Bethnal Green Academy in December after a friend of Amira\u2019s, a Muslim girl of 15 who has not been named, disappeared to Syria. They talked to Amira and her two new friends, but concluded they were not being groomed by ISIS online recruiters. Yet one of Amira\u2019s friends insists: \u2018By the time the police came, Amira had isolated herself from non-Muslim pupils. I am surprised the police did not discover she was already fascinated with the Islamic State and people like Jihadi John.\u2019 Runner: At 13 and 14 Amira was a star of the school athletics squad, competing across Southern England in the 800 and 1,200 metres . Amira left her family home in the morning of Tuesday, February 17, telling her father she was going to a wedding. He believed her. She was carrying no luggage, although CCTV shows her and the other girls at Gatwick before boarding a flight with heavy holdalls. Who gave them the bags? Was it an on-the-ground ISIS recruiter in London? The question has not yet been answered. The bags contained the Islamic robes and coats with hoods that the girls were wearing by the time they reached Istanbul. By late morning on the Tuesday, Amira had inputed her father, 47-year-old Abase Hussen, who thought his daughter was at the wedding. She said it was \u2018a little bit far\u2019, and added: \u2018Daddy, I will pray my midday prayer and get back home.\u2019 At midnight, the family reported Amira missing and were desperately messaging her school friends to see if she was with them. One of her old friends admits now: \u2018I was getting worried about her. She told girls in school that she agreed with what the Islamic State was doing in Syria. \u2018I feel that I have lost my friend for ever.\u2019 She is probably right.\n",

        "input": "Apology: David Duckenfield says he never had the chance to say sorry over the Hillsborough disaster . The police chief on duty during the Hillsborough disaster today said that he had never previously apologised for lying to officials because he had 'never found an opportunity' to do so. David Duckenfield told the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans during the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989 that he had not spoken out because was worried about being misrepresented. The former officer also admitted he was 'possibly in denial' over his misleading statement that a gate had been forced open by fans, leading to a deadly crush on the terraces of the Sheffield stadium. He told the jury he was a Freemason at the time of the accident, but said he hoped that was not a factor in his promotion to the position of chief superintendent. And he denied taking part in a 'cover-up' designed to divert blame from the police by ascribing the disaster to Liverpool fans' bad behaviour. Yesterday, Mr Duckenfield said he 'apologised unreservedly' to the families of the victims who were killed in the opening minutes of the game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Shortly before kick-off the officer - who had never previously overseen a major football match - ordered a gate to be opened in order to ease overcrowding outside the ground, but this allowed fans to rush into to already packed terraces. When fans started dying, Mr Duckenfield told Football Association officials that 'some fans have got in through a gate', which he now admits was a 'terrible lie'. Rajiv Menon QC, lawyer for the victims' families, asked him why it took him 26 years to 'come clean' over his 'critical mistakes'. Mr Duckenfield, 70, replied: 'I was possibly in denial and I never found a venue or an opportunity where I could meet with someone and speak to them honestly and openly and ensure that my thought and my feelings would be reported fairly. 'Yesterday this court gave me the opportunity to sit here and apologise fully for the first time without fear of anybody misrepresenting what I was saying.' Crush: 96 Liverpool fans were killed by being pushed up against barriers on the overcrowded terrace . He denied saying anything inaccurate to FA officials Graham Kelly and Glen Kirton, but confessed he had told a 'lie by omission' for failing to mention that he gave the order to open the gate, and added that it was his family who told him what he had done. He said: 'I have spoken to my family, who are genuine people, and I have said I am troubled by this situation and they said to me, \"Well you obviously lied because you didn't tell the whole truth.\"' Mr Duckenfield, who was promoted to be an area commander at South Yorkshire Police two weeks before the semi-final, told the jury that he was not a 'reasonably competent match commander' due to his lack of experience. Asked if he was a member of the Freemasons at the time of the disaster, Mr Duckenfield said, 'I was,' adding that he had joined the organisation in 1975 and was made Worshipful Master of his local lodge in 1990. He said he did not know whether the chief constable of his force or other senior officers were in the Masons because it was not seen as 'acceptable' to be a senior policeman and a Freemason. Mr Menon asked if Mr Duckenfield's promotion to chief superintendent in March 1989 was anything to do with his membership of the Masons. He replied: 'I would not know but I would hope not. Nobody ever spoke to me about it.' At one point Mr Menon put it to Mr Duckenfield that there had been a 'false narrative' after the disaster which sought to blame Liverpool fans for what had happened and conceal the truth about police failings. After pausing to consider his answer, Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I disagree. There was no conspiracy as far as I am concerned.' Rejecting claims that he suspected there were fatalities by the time he spoke to Mr Kelly, Mr Duckenfield added: 'I don't think I was involved in any cover-up whatsoever. 'My main objective was a rescue operation and to do the very best I could for all concerned. It was chaotic, hectic, stressful.' Chaos: Fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster . After claiming that no one in the court room would understand the position he found himself in, Mr Duckenfield was asked why he had concealed the truth from Mr Kelly. 'Sir, I said yesterday, I don't know,' Mr Duckenfield responded. Mr Menon then said to the former officer: 'That's not the way that a competent match commander behaves, is it Mr Duckenfield, lying to the chief executive of the Football Association when people are dying on the pitch feet away?' Mr Duckenfield answered: 'Sir, under normal circumstances, as I have said, outside in the street or in an office, it is not the normal way you would expect. 'But we are not talking about normal circumstances, we are talking about a massive tragedy and me doing my best under very difficult circumstances.' Asked if he had always been consistent in his account of what he said in the control box, the former chief superintendent said: 'It may be that my recollections over 26 years, or what I have said about Mr Kelly, may vary, and, dare I say it, understandably.' Mr Menon later asked: 'Your negligence caused disaster and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, didn't it?' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I would not use the word negligence. Mistake, oversight. Sir, I did not foresee the consequence.' Mr Menon said that the former officer's failure to close the tunnel before opening the gates was a, 'blunder of the first magnitude.' Mr Duckenfield said, 'I can't deny it,' adding: 'I'm not making excuses, I have nothing to cover up, I have put my hands up and admitted my failings and I will continue to do so.' The officer told jurors he 'came clean' about giving the order to open the gate at about 4pm after returning to the control box from a visit to Hillsborough's boardroom. Whilst in the boardroom - in the presence of directors from Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool - Mr Duckenfield again failed to mention that he had authorised the gate to be opened. After leaving the ground and travelling to South Yorkshire Police headquarters on the evening of April 15, Mr Duckenfield said he was summoned to brief Chief Constable Peter Wright. Mr Menon asked Mr Duckenfield how the chief constable had reacted when he was informed that the head of the FA had been lied to. Mr Duckenfield said: 'Sir, I think the best answer to that is that he was very unhappy overall. I remember walking into his office. 'He was sat behind his desk and he wasn't best pleased about the events. I just remember having related my story to him and being dismissed like a schoolboy out of the headmaster's office.' Asked about the testimony he gave to the initial Taylor Inquiry into the disaster, a few months after the match, Mr Duckenfield said he 'should not have been giving evidence' because he was traumatised. He also suggested that post-traumatic stress disorder had affected his memory of events. The hearing continues tomorrow. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",

        "input": "A video has emerged believed to show ISIS executioner Jihadi John ranting on camera shortly after he arrived in Syria from the UK. The footage is of two bands of fanatical fighters joining forces in 2013 under the command of notorious terrorist Omar al-Shishani. At the front stands a man thought to be Mohammed Emwazi - the west Londoner last week unmasked as the killer of Western hostages in a series of videos which have shocked the world. A man thought to be Jihadi John proclaims allegiance to a terror group in footage filmed in 2013. The video is thought to be the first known appearance by the executioner now unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi . The video is thought to have been filmed just months after Emwazi is understood to have fled Britain to take up arms alongside the extremists. It shows a pledge of allegiance made when the so-called 'Army of Muhammad Brigades' group joined forces with the so-called 'Brigade of Migrants', of which Emwazi is believed to have been a member. The speaker proclaims: 'This army announces unity within its ranks for the sake of implementing the Shariah and returning this blessed land to God the most glorified and the most high under the leadership of the emir Umar al-Shishani.' Emwazi, now 26, attempted to join al-Shabaab in Somalia after finishing his university course in London in 2009, but was refused entry to Tanzania and returned to Britain, from where he later went to Syria. He is thought to have been in a group who were among the first to go to fight in the Middle East, along with fellow Londoners Ibrahim al-Mazwagi, Choukri Ellekhlifi and Mohammad el-Araj. Ellekhlifi was two years above Emwazi in his north London school, Quinton Kynaston Academy, and later became part of a robbery gang which carried out a series of raids in central London. Ellekhlifi, 22, fled to Syria while on bail and was killed fighting near Aleppo in August 2013, months after the video thought to feature Emwazi was filmed. El-Araj, 23, was killed two weeks later during a firefight. Al-Mazwagi, from North London was 21 when he was killed in Syria in February last year. Emwazi was last week unmasked as the killer who carried as series of beheadings of Western hostages . In the film, the man thought to be Emwazi stands in front of notorious terror leader Omar al-Shishani (right) Emwazi's links to the London crime gang meant he had developed a love of violence, which led to him being chosen to feature in the beheading videos for which is now known throughout the world. In the latest video, the man suspected of being Emwazi stands at the front of a long line of gun-toting militants, with al-Shishani standing behind him arm-in-arm with two other fighters. Commenting on the likenesses of Emwazi to the speaking in the latest video to emerge, Raffaello Pantucci of the Royal United Service Institute told MailOnline: 'Given he\u2019s masked, it is difficult to make the precise connection between the two, though there are definite similarities. 'Given the group and community that Emwazi came from \u2013 the West London group - were all alongside the Katiba al Muhajireen under Omar al Shishani, it might well fit that it could be Emwazi. 'Given his solid Arabic and his willingness to be front and centre in films, it would fit that it could be him. Al Shishani seems to have been quite willing to record films of himself with his foreign fighter warriors.' Charles Winter from the Quilliam Foundation added: 'There are certainly similarities between Emwazi and the man speaking in this video, the eyebrows for example. 'In terms of the group, we know that it has a large proportion of foreign fighters so there's a possibility that he could have joined but I'm unable to say whether it is definitely him. The video shows a pledge of allegiance to Omar al-Shishani, now a commander of ISIS in Syria . Emwazi is thought to a fighter (second right beneath flag) who appears in another photo featuring al-Shishani . Mr Winter added: 'While he does have certain features that resemble Emwazi, there have been numerous false alarms with ID-ing \"Jihadi John\" in the past. A balaclava does a lot to obscure one's face, and a lot to make people look similar, too.' Others have cast doubt on whether the man is Emwazi, saying the speaker in the film looks shorter than the Londoner and appears to be holding the Kalashnikov rifle with his right hand, whereas Jihadi John held his knife in his left hand. If the video does show Emwazi, the footage would be the first known time he appeared on camera in Syria after going to fight. It is believed he was one of more than 700 fighters in The Migrants Brigade who arrived in the Middle East three years ago. The group were not part of ISIS at the time the video was filmed, but joined the group in the months that followed. Emwazi has since become one the world's most wanted men after he appeared in a series of gruesome videos beheading a series of foreign hostages, including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Mohammed Emwazi is believed to have among a group of Brits, which also includes Ibrahim al-Mazwagi (left), Choukri Ellekhlifi (centre) and Mohammad el-Araj (right), who were among the first to travel to Syria to fight . Ibrahim al-Mazwagi (centre), the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria, is pictured here with\u00a0Abu Omar al-Shishani (right), one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq . Omar al-Shishani has moved from the conflicts of the Caucasus, south of Russia to become one of the most feared commanders in the ISIS army now terrorising Syria and Iraq . Omar al-Shishani, whose real name is Tarkhan Batirashvili, is an ethnic Chechen from the Caucasus nation of Georgia, specifically from the Pankisi Valley, a centre of Georgia's Chechen community and once a stronghold for militants. He fought in the brief conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008 and became a jihadist after being discharged from the Georgian military on health grounds after contracting tuberculosis. After recuperating and being refused re-enlistment, he was arrested for stockpiling weapons and jailed in September 2010. Following his release, he travelled to Istanbul in Turkey in March 2012 to join Chechen rebels in the Syrian conflict. The red-bearded fanatic became the commander of the Brigade of Migrants, which was initially aligned with al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra. The group merged with other jihadists in March 2013 to form the Army of Emigrants and Supporters, a larger and more structured group with a religious council. In May 2013, Shishani switched to supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and has become the group's military commander in Syria, leading it on an offensive to take over a broad stretch of territory leading to the Iraq border. Numerous reports of his death since then are thought to be untrue.\n",

        "input": "Atlanta (CNN)This is a tale of two storms. The one that (kind of) hit Atlanta and the one that hit everywhere else. Atlanta's was anti-climactic. Everywhere else was worse. Ask folks along a line from Arkansas to Virginia. Unlike last year, when city officials were caught completely by surprise, Atlanta was prepared this time. But the storm stayed north of town. It did do some damage, slicking up roads and knocking out power to tens of thousands of people. Still, Snowmageddon 2015 it wasn't. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal did his part. He ordered a state of emergency for 51 northern counties. Authorities were ready too. There were more snow plows, more trucks to spread brine and they were out in force ahead of the bad weather. And people helped out by staying home or leaving work early. Still, social media wasn't about to give the governor a break. \"As a stockholder of a grocery store here, I appreciate you guys invoking a false panic again. #ATLsnow,\" tweeted Tommy Sale. North of the city, there was lots of snow, especially in the mountains, but Atlanta mainly got rain. It was a disappointing prospect for those who had their hearts set on making a snowman from a rare snowfall. \"Serious question, how am I supposed to build a snowman with rain?\" asked Angelica Monteon. \"lol, a little imagination and your freezer,\" responded Ashley Hamilton. Other parts of the South found enough snow to put together more than your basic snowman. In northeast Mississippi they were channeling \"Star Wars\" and the ice planet Hoth in creating a snowy version of an Imperial walker. In Alabama, the snow inspired a host of Elsas, Annas and Olafs to spread their wintry magic \"Frozen\" style. By early Thursday, the storm system had largely left the Deep South behind, instead spreading a blanket of white on the Carolinas and northward. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory noted that this marked the second time in two years that a major winter storm covered his entire state. There were no casualties or major injuries, thankfully, but the central part of the state got up to 7 inches while a few inches fell in the east. It wasn't just that snow fell, but the type of snow -- heavy stuff that snapped branches and weighed down power lines, especially in Durham and Wake counties. That led to some 224,000 Duke Energy customers being in the dark at one point, a number that had fallen to about 78,000 by 6:25 p.m. Thursday. \"The biggest issue for us, especially Greensboro to the east, was power outages,\" McCrory said. \"That is something that ... we didn't anticipate.\" Thankfully, though, North Carolinians were ready in other ways. They heeded officials' warnings by stocking up, staying off the roads and staying safe. The storm did leave behind its share of slippery misery. North of Atlanta, Interstate 75 was in gridlock Wednesday afternoon. Catching flights was a nightmare in some southern cities. Atlanta, Dallas and Charlotte were the hardest hit. Some 1,600 flights were canceled at all U.S. airports on Wednesday. Nearly 900 have been scrubbed for Thursday. In Alabama, Joe Day and some friends thought it would be better for them to drive home to Evansville, Indiana, instead of worrying with canceled flights. They didn't make it far. They were stuck on I-65 about 30 miles north of Birmingham. Day says a hill and snow-covered roadways led to backed-up traffic for miles. In Tennessee, 30 weather-related deaths have been reported in the past 10 days. A small child died in Mississippi after the car she was in hydroplaned. And a student from the University of Mississippi in Oxford was killed in a sledding accident Wednesday. The South's fascination with snow is a bit bemusing for those who live north of the Mason-Dixon line. After all, in Boston, they were over winter about 70 inches ago. \"How's the snow treating you, southern US folks? Having fun yet?\" asked Canadian L.M. Murphy on Twitter. \"DON'T MOCK OUR SOUTHERN SNOW PANIC!\" warned Whitney Waddell in Nashville. And then there was this bit of empathy from points north. \"I love all the snow pictures of my southern friends because they actually appreciate the snow,\" tweeted Abby Kreuser.\n",

One of Scotland\u2019s most successful cricketers has been sent home from the World Cup in disgrace after suggesting his axing from a match was racially motivated. Majid Haq, the country\u2019s leading wicket-taker and most capped player, was ordered to fly back early from Australia for breaching the team\u2019s code of conduct. Haq was not selected for the team that lost to Sri Lanka in Hobart yesterday and later tweeted: \u2018Always tougher when your in the minority! #colour #race\u2019, before later deleting the post. After the match, Cricket Scotland broke the news in a brief statement that 32-year-old Haq was coming home early, adding: \u2018No further statement will be issued until internal processes have been completed.\u2019 The Paisley-born cricketer now faces a disciplinary hearing which could decide whether his distinguished ten-year career continues or is brought to an ignominious end. The spin bowler, who made his first-class debut with the national team in 2004, suffered mixed fortunes in the World Cup in which Scotland has lost all five pool matches so far. It has a last game on Saturday in which to register a win, but that\u2019s a tall order against four-time champions and co-hosts Australia. Haq took three wickets in Scotland\u2019s first four matches, and was dropped after bowling figures of 0-49 and scoring only one run in the defeat to Bangladesh at Nelson in New Zealand on March 5. In the match against England on February 22, offspinner Haq dismissed opener Moeen Ali to claim a record 257th wicket for Scotland. Former England all-rounder Ian Botham and ex-coach David Lloyd ruffled feathers when they branded the Clydesdale Cricket Club bowler a \u2018lobber\u2019 in their TV commentary. At the time, Scotland\u2019s director of cricket Andy Tennant, a specialist spin coach, came to his player\u2019s defence, insisting he was \u2018world class\u2019. Tennant said: \u2018The commentators kept going on about how slowly Maj was bowling but his flight and dip in the air is what makes him a special bowler. Haq was dropped from Scotland's squad for their defeat to Sri Lanka yesterday after bowling figures of 0-49 and scoring just one run in the previous game, but suggested the move was racially motivated . \u2018What they portrayed as a weakness is actually a strength. I think the remarks came across as ill-informed. Majid should be rightly proud of what he has achieved for Scotland and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll go on to take many more wickets for his country.\u2019 Haq holds the Scottish record for most international cricket caps \u2013 209 \u2013 and was presented with a trophy for becoming lead wicket-taker following the England match. Coach Grant Bradburn said in a statement: \u2018It is a huge honour and fantastic achievement for Majid, who now becomes Scotland\u2019s leading wicket-taker of all time. 'As such a loyal servant to Scotland Cricket, it is especially appropriate for Majid to achieve this milestone during our World Cup campaign.\u2019 Coach Grant Bradburn had previously praised Haq when he collected a record 209th cap for Scotland, but his tweet has since dampened the mood . However, the buoyant mood in the Scotland camp generated by Haq\u2019s achievements has been dampened by his tweet. A Cricket Scotland statement yesterday said: \u2018Following a breach of Cricket Scotland\u2019s internal code of conduct, international team member, Majid Haq, is travelling home from the ICC World Cup. \u2018No further statement will be issued until internal processes have been completed in due course.\u2019 Haq, whose family is of Pakistani heritage and ran a curry restaurant in Glasgow, was brought up in Paisley, Renfrewshire, attending Castlehead High School and Reid Kerr College. He later graduated in accountancy at the former University of Paisley. He worked part-time as an accountant before switching to cricket full-time six years ago. In an interview last month, Haq revealed that the last World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand, in 1992, helped him fall in love with the game, with Pakistan\u2019s victory in the final against England a seminal moment. BBC radio commentator and former England off-spinner Vic Marks said yesterday he was \u2018shocked\u2019 that Haq\u2019s tour should end in such fashion. He said: \u2018I understand why any player would be really disappointed about being dropped \u2013 it\u2019s a horrible feeling, especially if you are a senior player. 'I can also understand from the Scottish selectors\u2019 point of view that it was an opportunity to blood a talented young offspinner and that might be why they took the step to drop Haq. \u2018I guess the authorities were left with no real option once he\u2019d delivered his tweet. They had to take pretty severe action.\u2019\n",

The 21-year-old, who picked up a neck injury playing against New Zealand back in November, said he was now at peak fitness despite playing a total of just 94 minutes of professional rugby in 2015. \u2018I played in the Munster game a few weeks ago and that was my first game back after three months out,\u2019 said Ashe. \u2018I had a bit of a reaction with my neck a few days after but it settled down quickly enough. That was always going to happen coming back from my injury. \u2018Although I have not played much rugby, I am hungry for it. I am not just physically ready but also mentally ready, too. I want to go out there and give everything I\u2019ve got against Ireland. \u2018It was tough missing the first three Six Nations games through injury but I am glad to be back involved and able to do my part.\u2019\n",

In the latest sign that a feel-good factor is returning to the economy, shares in Britain's biggest blue chip companies went through the 7,000 barrier for the first time. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares rose 60.19 points to 7022.51, giving a confidence boost to millions of savers and people with pensions. All smiles: George Osborne, at Old Trafford today, received a treble boost - as\u00a0hares hit a record high, government borrowing tumbled, and the Tories saw a modest 'Budget bounce' in the polls . Taking it in: The Chancellor, with former England and Manchester United midfielder Sir Bobby Charlton, can take satisfaction from a YouGov Poll that showed the Budget had been well received by voters . The Chancellor was also cheered by a YouGov poll showing Wednesday's Budget has gone down well with voters. The survey gave the Tories a two-point lead over Labour \u2013 reversing a one-point Labour lead in a similar poll carried out just before the Budget. It put the Conservatives on 35 points, with Labour on 33. There was further good news for the Conservatives when official figures revealed that government borrowing fell by a third in February to \u00a36.9billion, \u00a33.5billion lower than it was in February last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Annual borrowing for the year to February stood at \u00a381.8billion, 9.7 per cent lower than last year, leaving the Chancellor well on course to meet his updated target for cutting the huge deficit left by Labour. However the ONS was also forced to revise up the national debt after admitting an embarrassing \u00a35.5billion miscalculation over the Government's bailed-out bank assets. In safe hands: Official figures revealed that government borrowing fell by a third in February to \u00a36.9billion, \u00a33.5billion lower than it was in February last year . Mr Osborne also went on the offensive, publishing Treasury figures which suggest Labour would borrow a staggering \u00a3138billion more than the Tories if they seize power in May. He told the Federation of Small Businesses conference in Birmingham that Labour's plans were a 'clear and present danger' to the economy. He later told LBC radio that \u2013 unlike Labour \u2013 the Tories would start to pay down Britain's \u00a31.5trillion national debt. Pushing forward: Mr Osborne\u00a0told the Federation of Small Businesses conference in Birmingham that Labour's plans were a 'clear and present danger' to the economy . He said: 'It sounds like an abstract concept, the national debt. But it means this country has to spend billions on interest repayments that could be spent on services like the NHS \u2013 and it harms growth. If the Labour Party get in then the national debt will start to rise again. We would be sliding back into economic chaos.'

If Nibali does take part it will be the first time the dominant four Grand Tour winners have all raced in the same WorldTour event, RCS Sport said. Contador (Tinkoff-Saxo) is the defending champion of the 'Race of the Two Seas' and has won all three Grand Tours, as has Nibali, who won the 2012 and 2013 Tirreno-Adriatico.

        "input": "A ten-year-old girl with a\u00a0rare but intractable form of epilepsy is leading the crusade to have marijuana extract oil approved for medicinal use in her home state of Idaho as a form of treatment for her deadly seizures. Alexis Carey, from Boise, has Dravet Syndrome, an incurable genetic disease that causes severe and multiple seizures, which often leave parents guessing if the terror of watching their child seize up will pass or turn fatal. After her family learned that oil extracted from marijuana had helped other children with her condition, they wanted to see if it would help her too, but Idaho\u2019s stringent marijuana laws do not allow for medicinal use. Family support: Alexis Carey (left), a 10-year-old girl with a rare form of epilepsy, sat with her mother Clare Carey (center) and five-year-old sister Alanis Carey (right) last Friday in Boise, Idaho . Helping hand: Alexis, who has Dravet Syndrome, worked with her therapist Brigette Borup last week as her family fights to have Idaho lawmakers legalize marijuana extract oil to treat her seizures . 'Parent to parent, when you're in a small community and 10 people that you know are all having success, that's no longer anecdotal,' Clare Carey, her mother, said. 'That's hope.' The family began lobbying lawmakers to decriminalize the oil almost two years ago. Now, they've got some legislative backers and an upcoming hearing, as Idaho joins a larger movement to loosen laws to allow the use of marijuana extract oil. Twelve states have legalized the oil while still banning medical marijuana. Virginia legalized the oil February 26. In Utah, lawmakers have given initial approval to let those with chronic and debilitating diseases consume edible marijuana products, while still banning smoking. Marijuana extract oil first received attention when a Colorado family fought and won for access for their daughter who also had Dravet Syndrome. It is similar to hemp oil, which is legal in Idaho and can be bought in grocery stores. With no known cure for Dravet Syndrome, children are often prescribed a cocktail of medications to counter the seizures. However, the heavy drugs often come with side-effects that can permanently damage a child's developing liver, kidneys and other organs. Proponents of cannabidiol oil, a non-psychotropic extract of marijuana, argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children. Over time, Mrs Carey hopes that the oil would also reduce the number of medications her daughter relies on. 'Like any parent, you never give up hope that you can get complete seizure control,' she said. 'Children die from Dravet by any one of the seizures. Alexis could have a seizure that may not stop, we never really know.' Sisterly bond: Alexis can be seen playing with Alanis. The 10-year-old girl began having seizures when she was only two months old . Natural remedy: This closeup image shows a drop of marijuana oil on the end of a needle.\u00a0Proponents of the oil for medicinal use argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children . Making a change: Governor Terry McAuliffe (center) holds Haley Smith, 14, from White Stone, Virginia on his lap after signing the bills that allow the possession of marijuana oils to help treat patients with epilepsy . Alexis began having seizures when she was two months old. But even in 2003, her mom says a lack of awareness of the disease led to many doctors not automatically suspecting it could be a rare, genetic disorder. It wasn't until Alexis lost all speech and potty control when she was two that doctors determined she had Dravet Syndrome, Mrs Carey said. Since then, Alexis' parents have put her on a variety of diets and medications to help reduce the seizures, but the disease is tricky to manage. Dravet Syndrome often causes a variety of different kinds of seizures but medications typically target one particular type. Alexis' seizures usually occur at night, which means one of her parents regularly sleep with her and monitor her sleep patterns. During the day, Alexis requires constant supervision. While most 10-year-olds freely run and jump around, Alexis walks - albeit sometimes unstably and with help going up and down stairs. Mrs Carey said working with Idaho's Republican-controlled Legislature has been easier than anticipated. Lawmakers who resisted the idea at first blush have warmed up to the idea, she explained. This year, the bill is endorsed by Republicans Senator Curt McKenzie and Representative Tom Loertscher. Both are chairs of the legislature's State Affairs Committees, panels that often get tossed controversial legislation and have a high bar for clearance. The measure unanimously passed the Senate committee during its introduction hearing, which means it now goes on to a full hearing in front of the committee. Yet the bill must survive a Statehouse that approved a resolution in 2013 vowing never to legalize marijuana for any purpose.\n",

The paedophiles were initially said to include MPs, senior police officers, and judges, but now investigators have revealed the net has been widened further. Over 30 years, officers from Scotland Yard are said to have also protected entertainers, actor, and priest by shutting down inquiries. The police watchdog has now added a further three alleged paedophilia cover-ups by the Metropolitan Police to the investigation, bring the total to 17 . Probe: Police allegedly stopped investing a child sex ring based in Dolphin Square in Westmister, pictured . The police watchdog has now added a further three alleged paedophilia cover-ups by the Metropolitan Police to the investigation, bring the total to 17. In a statement the IPCC said the police investigation had 'gathered evidence against MPs, judges, media entertainers, police, actors, clergy and others'. Criminal proceedings were being prepared, but two months later an officer was called in by a senior Metropolitan Police officer and told to drop the case, it is alleged. The IPCC is also looking into an allegation about police actions during a child abuse investigation in the 1980s, and another complaint about the same investigation - although no details of this have been given. Allegations: Sarah Green of the IPCC will oversee the investigation into the corruption claims . The watchdog said all the allegations relate to 'suppressing evidence, hindering or halting investigations' and the 'covering up the offences because of the involvement of members of parliament and police officers'. When the probe was announced earlier this month, commentators said It could be the biggest investigation into police corruption since the 1970s. The Metropolitan Police force is leading the investigation into the alleged corrupt actions of its officers but the IPCC says it is closely monitoring their probe. The IPCC had last week announced that it is investigating 14 allegations. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is also assessing a further six referrals it has received from the force as part of the case. When the investigation was launched The IPCC Deputy Chair Sarah Green said: 'These allegations are of historic, high level corruption of the most serious nature. 'We will oversee the investigations and ensure that they meet the terms of reference that we will set. 'Allegations of this nature are of grave concern and I would like to reassure people of our absolute commitment to ensuring that the investigations are thorough and robust.' The complex web of allegations was uncovered by detectives probing claims of historical sex abuse first raised by Labour MP Tom Watson in October 2012. The claims include that police deliberately stalled their inquiries into the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south-west London, leaving dozens of boys to be abused.

Louis Michael Rau, 46, faces 12 charges including seven counts of distributing sexually explicit matter to a minor; four counts of selling or furnishing alcohol to a minor; and one count of accosting a minor for immoral purposes -- which is a four-year felony, the Morning Sun\u00a0reports. Rau resigned from his position at the Beal City High School in January after complaints from parents about the coach's alleged inappropriate conduct led to an investigation by the Isabella County Sheriff's Department. Multiple Charges: Louis Rau, 46 (photographed), was arrested Friday and faces multiple charges including sending explicit images to students as young as 13 years old . During the investigation, the department conducted several interviews and searched phones, tablets, cameras, computers, DVD's, input messages and emails, Sheriff Leo Mioduszewski told MLive. The search found that Rau sent nude photos to five victims -- all student-athletes -- between 2011 and 2015,\u00a0People\u00a0reports. One of the victims was 13 when the ex-coach began sending him the sexually explicit photos, and all of the others were under 18 years old. Court records obtained by the Sun state that in addition to the photos, Rau gave the boys sex toys. Rau reportedly once gave an eighth grader a toy 'described as a vagina with a tube.' On four different occasions, the Sun reports, Rau purchased alcohol for three of the victims; court records note that both input messages and Rau's admission confirmed the purchases. Victims: The search found that Rau sent nude photos to five victims -- all student-athletes -- between 2011 and 2015 . Toys/Alcohol: Court records state that in addition to the photos, Rau also gave the boys sex toys and bought them alcohol . At Friday's arraignment, Rau's attorney, Dan O'Neill, described Rau as a 'home-grown boy' and noted that the 46-year-old had no criminal record, the Sun reports. He spoke of Rau's notoriety as 'the most celebrated football coach Beal City has ever had.' Rau's bail was set at $80,000, lowered from $120,000 which was set during the time of his arrest, the Sun reports. Upon his resignation, Rau, who also served as a substitute teacher at the school, was banned from school grounds except for school board meetings and public elections held at the school, MLive reports. As part of his bail conditions, Rau is not allowed in any school zones, not allowed to be in the presence of minors, not allowed to attend sporting events where minors or present, and is not allowed to contact the victims in any way, according to MLive. In 2006, Rau received a 14-day unpaid suspension for allegedly slapping a player at a football banquet.

Polls last week suggested the nationalists could win 50 out of the 59 Westminster seats in May, including those seen as the safest Labour strongholds such as Gordon Brown\u2019s in Kirkcaldy.

On Friday, Mr Salmond, the former SNP leader who is expected to lead the party in Westminster after the election, said Scotland could \u2018call the tune\u2019 in the Commons. \u2018It is now clear that neither Tory nor Labour will win an overall majority,\u2019 he said. \u2018Neither are fit to govern. \u2018It is also clear that Scotland is swinging behind SNP candidates the length and breadth of the country. In that situation Scotland can call the tune in the next Westminster Parliament.\u2019 At the same time, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon removed the biggest obstacle to a Labour-SNP deal by ditching her red line on Trident. She said her party could back a minority Labour government in key votes even if it had not secured an agreement to scrap the nuclear deterrent. Labour MPs say the party has \u2018decided internally\u2019 not to rule out an SNP pact before the election. This will be particularly concerning to English voters who fear the price of concessions the SNP will seek to extract from Labour in return for handing Mr Miliband the keys to No 10. Peeping from the breast pocket of a giant Alex Salmond, Ed Miliband is portrayed as a mere plaything of the SNP in the Tories\u2019 latest poster. Lips pursed, he appears pensive and childlike as the larger-than-life Scottish nationalist looks down on him with a patronising smirk. The poster\u2019s clear aim is to suggest Mr Salmond will have free rein to boss Mr Miliband around if their parties form a coalition in May. Last night the pair were immediately dubbed \u2018Big Eck and Little Ed\u2019. The Tory campaign drew comparisons to ITV\u2019s Spitting Image, which mercilessly lampooned politicians in the 1980s and 1990s. Its targets included David Owen and David Steel, joint leaders of the SDP/Liberal Alliance. Mr Steel was lampooned as Mr Owen\u2019s adoring sidekick and sometimes appeared in his pocket, left.

The 30-year-old last hit the back of the net from a set-piece in the Spanish league on March 26 last year against Sevilla. His last goal from a free-kick in any competition came in the Champions League last April against Bayern Munich. He has now failed to score a single goal with any of his last 51 free-kicks. Cristiano Ronaldo has gone almost a year without scoring a free-kick in La Liga . Ronaldo deploys his trademark technique as he attempts a free-kick against Villarreal last Sunday . Ronaldo and team-mate Gareth Bale (left) line up a free-kick against Getafe in January . In any straw poll of best set-piece deliverers Ronaldo would be top of many people\u2019s lists but the statistics tell a completely different story, and while his figures are poor Bale\u2019s are far more impressive. Ronaldo has sent 21 of his efforts straight into the wall and placed 14 high or wide of the target; while keepers or posts and crossbars have done for the rest. Gareth Bale has only scored once this season but it is Real\u2019s only goal scored from a free-kick. And although Bale insisted recently on Spanish radio that he tends to take the kicks that favour a left-footer and Ronaldo those that favour a right foot, more often than not it is the Portuguese who takes precedence. When Bale scored from a free-kick against Espanyol in January the strike-rates of Europe\u2019s set-piece specialists were published by Spanish football statistician Mister Chip and they made tough reading for Ronaldo. Ronaldo's last goal from a free-kick came in last season's Champions League against AC Milan in April . Bale fires a free-kick over the Atletico Madrid wall during a La Liga clash at the Bernabeu . Midfielder Toni Kroos could also take over free-kick duties for Real Madrid from Ronaldo . Bale scores a free-kick every 9.5 attempts while Ronaldo's ratio is one every 15.6 attempts. Bale also came out ahead of Andrea Pirlo who scores one every 10.5 attempts and Leo Messi who scores every 14 times he takes a free-kick. Madrid have various options from a dead ball with Toni Kroos and Isco both ready to step in. They also have James Rodriguez and Sergio Ramos on their way back from injury to put more pressure on Ronaldo, and with Martin Odegaard being tipped to play some part in Real\u2019s Champions League second leg with Schalke on Tuesday there is even a 16-year-old pretender to the crown.\n",

Wales assistant coach McBryde has stressed the winner-takes-all nature of a game that sees both teams featuring prominently at the tournament's business end. Ireland are two victories away from a first Six Nations Grand Slam since 2009, while Wales must triumph on Saturday to remain in the mix for silverware. Sam Warburton (right) will lead his country for a record 34th time when he takes the field against Ireland . Wales coach Warren Gatland (centre) leads his players onto the pitch at the Millenium Stadium . Wales will look to Racing Metro inside centre Jamie Roberts to get them over the gainline against Ireland . Warburton (centre) leads the warm-up as Gatland's side complete their final preparations in Cardiff . 'It's going to be an arm-wrestle for 80 minutes, and that is what we've prepared for,' McBryde said. 'Everything that goes on off the field pales into insignificance, and it's all about what happens on the day. 'They play a big pressure game, and if we can react positively to that and stay in the fight, that will give us a good chance of winning. 'There is a lot of stake. Ireland are on course for a Grand Slam, and just to get away from Cardiff with a win, that's all they will be looking to do. With regards to playing any attractive rugby, that will come second. 'That's the nature of the game at the moment, and that's how teams are wearing each other down, and unfortunately, the spectators have got to pay a price for that.' Warburton is in high spirits during the captain's run as his side prepare for visit of Joe Schmidt's side . Ireland have conceded just one try in three Six Nations games this season and an average of only nine points per time across eight Six Nations matches Joe Schmidt has overseen during his coaching reign. Ireland are also on a 10-Test unbeaten run - England were the last team to defeat them 13 months ago - and McBryde added: 'They are on a a bit of a roll at the moment. Ten wins on the bounce speaks volumes. 'This is quite a formidable Ireland team, and we are going to have to be at our best to come close to them tomorrow. Warburton and Co will be looking to avenge their 26-3 loss to Ireland in Dublin last season . 'You have got arguably two of the better teams in the Six Nations, not being disrespectful to anybody else. On our day, I think both teams are capable of beating anybody. 'With regards to motivation, we look at our own situation, and we know a win would give us an opportunity to go for the championship. 'It is a double-edged sword that one. By doing that, we beat Ireland and stop them getting a Grand Slam, but it's all about what we can achieve and gain, as opposed to anything else.'\n",

For a time it was hard to know if his premature end would be via red card or substitution. Fabian Delph of England speaks to the media during the England press conference ahead of the clash with Italy . Delph left his mark on the Swiss in more ways than one, adding much-needed bite to Roy Hodgson\u2019s midfield . Delph \u00a0cleaned up his disciplinary record to help international career after collecting 20 yellows in two years . The Aston Villa midfielder soon settled, however, and it turned out to be neither. He produced a terrific display in Basle and won his fourth cap against Lithuania on Friday. He has also cleaned up his disciplinary record to help his international career and, after collecting 20 in two years, has just one yellow and one red in 26 appearances this season for club and country. \u2018You\u2019ve got to be more careful,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I like to tackle and I\u2019ve managed to curb it this season. I got the yellow against Switzerland and then the red against Sunderland but other than that I\u2019ve been pretty clean. I\u2019m usually on about nine or 10 bookings at this stage! \u2018It\u2019s hard to lunge into tackles in international football. If you lunge in on a top-class international footballer they just skip round you or you bring them down. I tried to set a target. I\u2019ve been able to do that so I\u2019m quite proud.\u2019 Harry Kane made a big impact on debut twith his goal after just 79 seconds seconds at Wembley Stadium . Both Kane and Delph shone for England as Roy Hodgson's side swept Lithuania aside at Wembley . Even so, his natural aggression lifted England in Switzerland, where a 2-0 win restored some of the confidence lost at the World Cup. \u2018I remember lining up a few tackles and getting them wrong, but it didn\u2019t faze me,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018It was one of those things. I tried to impose myself early on and mistimed it. After that it was just about trying to stay on my feet, trying to get through the game, trying to perform well, with good energy, keep the ball moving and I managed to do that.\u2019 Dennis Wise can testify to this fondness for physical combat having been cut down by a teenage Delph during one of the regular games between the Leeds staff and youth team. Wise, manager at Elland Road at the time, liked his style and picked him for the first team before he was 18. Lithuania's Tomas Mikuckis tracks Aston Villa and England midfielder Delph during the game at Wembley . \u2018Those games did get quite tasty,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I did tackle him and he tackled me back. They tended to get quite heated. He gave me my debut. I\u2019m so grateful to Dennis. And Gus Poyet, his assistant. Gus could kick a few people as well.\u2019 This breakthrough rewarded years of commitment from Delph and his mother Donna, who would hop on various buses and trains together to get to academy training sessions. \u2018It\u2019s funny to look back on this little kid jumping off the bus to training,\u2019 he said. \u2018At one point, it would take three buses and one train. But it\u2019s worked out well. I\u2019ve always been pushed hard to succeed. To get those buses, it was nothing.\u2019 As soon as he was able, he bought his mother a house. \u2018She\u2019s my hero,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018We didn\u2019t have a car, so she took me on the bus or on the train and she believed in me. She was just a great Mum and a great role model.\u2019 Delph speaks to the media at an England press conference ahead of the midweek clash with Italy . Determination is a recurring theme for Delph, who swapped hometown Bradford for Leeds at the age of 11 and then joined Villa for \u00a36million in 2009, only to be hit by serious knee injuries. \u2018I ruptured my anterior cruciate ligament, had bad medial ligament damage and tore my lateral meniscus and (knee surgeon) Andy Williams managed to save that,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I got back quite quickly and then broke down four times. I did my medial again on the other knee and then the knees were done and it was my ankles; the left ankle, the right ankle a few times. It was a rollercoaster ride. It made me stronger. It made me realise how much it takes to play at a high level and physically be strong. I worked really hard in the gym. Aston Villa midfielder Delph has a pop at goal during England's clash with Lithuania at Wembley Stadium . \u2018I was confident of coming out the other end but there were always questions. Is he going to get back to his best? Is he going to be the same player?\u2019 As it turned out, he did get back, won his place back in the Villa team and took his England opportunity in the absence of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. He missed two months with a shoulder injury soon after breaking into Hodgson\u2019s team but bounced back again, signing a new deal which ties him to Villa Park until 2019. At 25, Delph is a regular in the England midfield. He is still making an impression, five months after his explosive full debut, and he has the cards under control.\n",

The US official and the now desperate Dan\u2019s corner men agreed to call a merciful halt. VIDEOS Scroll down for Kell Brook's reaction post-fight and his thoughts on Amir Kahn . Kell Brook celebrates stunning return to the ring with his partner\u00a0Lindsey on Saturday night . Brook retained IBF welterweight world title by beating\u00a0Jo Jo Dan in Sheffield . This was all Brook could have hoped for after having his left thigh slashed to the bone by a machete wielding hooligan barely six months ago. Having feared either dying or being crippled, he came back fitter and stronger, just like the Six Million Dollar Man of old. There was not a trace of anxiety, a flicker of hesitation or an inkling inconvenience as smashed Dan to pieces. Kell Brook returned from an horrific knife attack to win his first IBF welterweight world title defence in style . Kelll Brook floored Romanian challenger Jo Jo Dan four times in four rounds on Saturday night . Brook \u00a0 \u00a0Dan . Round 1: \u00a0 \u00a0 10 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 9 .

This was an exceptional performance by Special K and the Motorpoint Arena rose to anoint Brook as Sheffield\u2019s rightful heir to the throne of Prince Naseem Hamed. The faithful joined him in calling out Khan for what Brook envisages as \u2018the biggest fight out there for both of us.\u2019 \u2018Who do you want to see me beat next,\u2019 he roared. \u2018Khan, Khan, Khan\u2019 came the deafening, blood-thirsty response. Six Million Dollars may be an underestimate for what they both could earn now from a stadium fight in late summer. Brook, already the IBF world champion stamped his credentials as a serious player in the welterweight division and will go to Las Vegas next month pressing his case for fighting the winner of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. But the Khan fight later this year is a more realistic option. Not that Khan would provide such a willing target as the Canadian-based Romanian who went through a world of pain. Brook was defending his IBF world title belt for the first time since beating Shawn Porter in LA last summer . Brook's range-finding left set up a hurtful right and then Dan was put down by a sharp uppercut . Not only did Brook win every round but he inflicted deadly punishment with a right hand which could not miss. The Motorpoint Arena was packed to the tank-full, waiting to welcome the fighter Sheffield believes can be its successor to Naseem Hamed. That atmosphere generator had to be restarted after the electric shock of seeing another son of the Steel City, Adam Etches, brutally knocked out by his veteran Belarus rival for the IBF international middleweight belt. The deeply experienced 40-year-old Sergei Khomitsky drew Etches into a clever trap midway through the third round, opening him up for the perfect right cross. Canada-based southpaw Dan had entered the ring a heavy underdog with a record of 34-3 with 18 early wins . Etches went down like an axed tree, crashing his head against the canvas as he landed, and there were no protests as referee Howard Foster instantly waves his arms over the prone body and summoned medical assistance. Video-screening of Brook\u2019s triumphs in the ring and his leg-slashed tribulations outside the ropes restored he mood of optimism. Special K came in to a thunder of expectation and to be greeted by famed Ready to Rumble announcer Michael Buffer. Dan had pronounced himself ready not only to rumble but to ignore the sound and fury of the partisan Sheffield crowd. Brook showed maturity to be patient, with 10,000 baying fans on their feet in his home town . Brook was dominant from the first bell and was ahead on the scorecards when the fight was stopped . He started brightly enough to suggest nerves might not be problem but he promptly pressed forward, playing into Brook\u2019s preference for counter punching. The home boy\u2019s straight lefts over the Canadian based Romanian\u2019s southpaw leads were especially effective and he was off to a good start. There were no signs of distress from that left leg which had been savagely severed. This time it was Brook inflicting the pain. One sharp sent Dan reeling. The next, an uppercut, put him down. The third sent him to the canvas again. Only a mix of gallantry and clinching got Dan through more punishment to the bell, which seemed more likely to have condemned him to a continuing world of pain rather than to have saved him. Special K stamped his credentials as a serious player in the welterweight division . Brook was looking for the finish but Dan managed to weather the storm at the opening of the round \u2013 and somehow fought back. The Brook attack was relentless and Dan reeled around the ring like a drunk, yet still made it to the end of another three minutes of hell. Brook's red shorts covered that wound on his left leg but there was no hiding place for his challenger. Dan was taking right hands to the head as if by habit and he went down for the third time from an accumulation of blows. Make that a fourth, Dan falling a split second before the bell. American referee Earl Brown completed the statutory eight count before agreeing with the challenger's corner that enough was enough.\n",

Leading out the Grand Slam chasers against Wales in the Six Nations in Cardiff on Saturday will be talisman Paul O'Connell, the giant lock who will be earning his 100th international cap. O'Connell has captained Ireland in all but two of the 16 tests since Schmidt took charge but his style of leadership means other players are given their head when it comes to making decisions in the heat of battle. Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton has been in superb form for his country this season . Ireland captain Paul O'Connell is set to win his 100th cap against Wales in Cardiff . Sexton works on his ball skills as head coach Joe Schmidt (right) watches on at the Millenium Stadium . 'One of the other things is that Paul doesn't assume every leadership responsibility, he delegates and he encourages and so that is one of the fantastic things for the coaches as well,' Schmidt told the Irish Times. 'It means Jamie (Heaslip) has a definite role. He has some particular things that he leads on, that Johnny Sexton does, that Rob Kearney does, Peter O'Mahony, we have got a number of provincial leaders, Rory Best, who step up and take different roles of leadership. 'So I think of the best things about Paul is that he doesn't try to carry the whole weight of leadership on his own shoulders.' O'Connell will pack down with Leinster lock Devin Toner in the engine room the Irish pack . 'He is incredibly driven to improve his own performance and thereby leads others in doing that.' Fly-half Sexton, who will win his 50th cap against Wales, said O'Connell's very presence, both on and off the field, is an inspiration. 'He's an outstanding leader,' Sexton said. 'When he speaks to the squad during the week the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. 'He know how important his words are.' Sexton's predecessor and long-time team mate of O'Connell, Ronan O'Gara added: 'Paul is very, very special in terms of the ability to deliver the right message at the right time.' That quality will be especially handy in the red-hot cauldron of the Millennium Stadium where Wales, after their opening loss to England, have put themselves back in contention for the title. Victory would leave the grand slam tantalisingly close with an away match against struggling Scotland to finish. 'It's a massive game for a whole lot of reasons. An opportunity to do what no Irish team has ever done in the history of the game,' Schmidt said.\n",

Tommy\u00a0Kr\u00e5ngh has become an overnight sensation in Sweden after putting on the performance of his life, interpreting pop singer Magnus Carlsson's attempt to enter Eurovision. But while Carlsson's upbeat tune may have failed to impress audiences in the Scandinavian country, being voted ninth out of 12 entries vying to represent at the annual competition, many are now calling for 48-year-old Kr\u00e5ngh to take the stage for Sweden in Vienna this May. Star:\u00a0Tommy Kr\u00e5ngh has become an overnight sensation in Sweden after he appeared on national television .

Shared: And it is all down to\u00a0Kr\u00e5ngh's exuberant interpretation - complete with hip wiggles . The video of\u00a0Kr\u00e5ngh's exuberant interpretation has been shared thousands of times in Sweden, and across the world. The delighted interpreter has told Swedish newspapers he was 'thrilled' with the reaction - and has been 'love-bombed' on Twitter by people who enjoyed his energetic performance, even getting the odd marriage proposal. 'It\u00b4s been absolutely amazing,' he told MailOnline. 'I\u00b4ve been love-bombed from a thousands of people. People are even proposing to marry me. This is something I could never imagine. 'It's a once in lifetime experience after being a signer for so many years. I love that sign language gets so much attention at the moment.' Hilarious:\u00a0Kr\u00e5ngh says he has been 'love-bombed' on social media since the show went out . Interpretation: He hopes his translation enables deaf people to get the 'feel' of the song . Water cooler: He wants deaf people to be able to discuss the song at work just like their hearing colleages . Kr\u00e5ngh told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet he 'just get funky and let go' when he got up on stage. Speaking to MailOnline, he added: 'The music is a part of your entire body. 'That is the charming thing with sign language it is so expressive and when you hear the music you basically freak out and loose yourself.' Meanwhile, he revealed that his aim is to ensure deaf people could grasp the message the singer was trying to convey. 'We get the songs a few weeks before the contest and then its up to you to analyze the song,' he explained. 'What is the message, if there is a message for that matter, what does the artist want with the song. How do you get into the rhythm and so forth. 'The important thing is that people who can\u00b4t hear is suppose to get the same experience as people who can. 'They should be able to have an opinion about the song, just like everyone else.'

Sweden is going to be represented by M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w this year, and he will no doubt be hoping to take home the trophy. But it seems the Swedes might be a little sad if Kr\u00e5ngh doesn't make an appearance. 'I know that M\u00e5ns will make us proud in Vienna, but I would not say no if I was asked,' he told MailOnline. 'Perhaps we could both be on stage,' added Kr\u00e5ngh, who also revealed his 'dream artist' to work with would be Celine Dion. Kr\u00e5ngh is not the first Swedish interpreter to capture the imagination of the nation. The last time Sweden won Eurovision three years ago with Euphoria, by Loreen, an interpreter managed to steal a bit of the limelight from the main act.

Labour voters were marginally more sympathetic to the idea, with 44 per cent in favour of some sort of deal, the survey by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft found. While the SNP has indicated it would not enter a formal coalition, it has suggested it would prop up a minority Labour government in key Commons votes in exchange for concessions.

He won more Labour seats than anyone 2. Tories are loaded 3. Do you want to win?\u2019 Labour activists responded angrily and praised the two women refusing the cash.

Dan Jarvis, who entered the Commons only four years ago, has told potential supporters he is prepared to run if Mr Miliband fails to dislodge David Cameron from No 10. One senior Labour MP, who met privately with Mr Jarvis in the Commons a month ago, said: \u2018Dan wants to go for it if the result is disappointing.' Ex-Special Forces:\u00a0Dan Jarvis has told potential supporters he is prepared to run if Mr Miliband fails to dislodge David Cameron from No 10 . He added: 'I thought about it for a couple of weeks, then rang him to say he could count on my backing.\u2019 The news has emerged as the Labour leader faces the embarrassment of two senior party figures openly debating his failings during a broadcast interview this week. With polling day barely six weeks away, Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk will discuss Mr Miliband\u2019s lack of voter appeal with party peer Lord Glasman in an interview broadcast on LBC on Monday evening. During the debate, Mr Danczuk asks: \u2018What has Nigel Farage got that Ed Miliband doesn\u2019t?\u2019 The peer \u2013 a former adviser to Mr Miliband \u2013 responds: \u2018He has got the ability to sit in the pub and be at his complete ease, which is a very magical gift. Ed is\u2026 from the seminar room.\u2019 Mr Jarvis, the Shadow Justice Minister, is rapidly gaining support on the party back benches as a \u2018clean skin\u2019 candidate who, unlike many rivals, was not an adviser or Minister during the Blair or Brown governments and is \u2018untainted\u2019 by association with Mr Miliband\u2019s inner circle. Some MPs also argue that the 42-year-old ex-Para\u2019s military career \u2013 a rarity in Labour ranks \u2013 would be more appealing to voters than Mr Miliband\u2019s background as a policy adviser.

He successfully stood in Barnsley Central in 2011, shortly after his wife Caroline died of cancer, aged 43, leaving him to care for their two children. Mr Jarvis has since remarried and now has a third child. The former major spent 15 years in the Paras, and was awarded an MBE after serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo and Sierra Leone. In keeping with his action-man image, it was reported last week he had pacified a drunken thug wielding a bottle who demanded his wallet.

        "input": "(CNN)This weekend marked the official opening of \"Fish in the Dark,\"\u200a\u200athe Broadway debut of Larry David of \"Seinfeld\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" fame. Of course, the odd conventions of live theater mean that \"Fish\" wasn't quite fresh-to-table at its premiere: It's been playing for several weeks now to sold-out preview crowds, to build buzz and iron out production kinks. And sold out really means sold out: The show has destroyed box office records for the vintage Cort Theatre and might yet set new ones for a nonmusical despite its limited run. That's because David has a huge built-in audience for his unique brand of humor, which \"Curb\" fans know to be as abrasive as sea salt and as astringent as lemon, unyielding in the face of social niceties, epic humiliation or even common human decency. It's polarizing, and the poles are pretty clearly drawn: By and large, fans of David's work tend to loudly proclaim that as long as abuse is sprayed pari passu\u200a -- \u200ae.g., proportionately in all directions\u200a -- \u200ano one should take offense. The nonfans tend to respond that this kind of comedy rests on an assumption defined by another common Latin phrase, ceteris paribus\u200a -- \u200ae.g., \"all other things being equal.\" And all other things are never equal in our world, by definition. When a group of affluent white protagonists in an almost exclusively white \"New York\" behave badly toward a handful of cartoonish parodies of working-class ethnic nobodies (a pretty fair synopsis of many \"Seinfeld\" episodes), it's hilarious if you belong to the former category. It's much less so when you belong to the latter. So it's not entirely surprising that some of the whispered early concerns with \"Fish\" related to the character of Fabiana, the Puerto Rican maid of the late patriarch of David's fictional family, the Drexels. Fabiana, played by Rosie Perez, and her son Diego play a pivotal part in the show, which takes place in the immediate wake (er, shiva?) of the passing of the elder Drexel; without spoiling the plot, suffice it to say that it hinges on upstairs-downstairs romantic antics and their inevitable consequences. And yes, some reviewers are using the \"R\"-word in calling out the depiction of Fabiana, eye-rolling over YASHDASM (Yet Another Stereotypical Hispanic Domestic And Single Mom) whose comic function is largely to mispronounce words and make cultural stumbles like bringing cuchifritos to a Jewish memorial service. But the conversation about race and representation isn't, and shouldn't be, absolutist based on content; coninput is just as important\u200a -- \u200aperhaps more so. What's the threeway balance of power between the author, the actors and the intended audience? Are a performance's questionable aspects racially exceptionalized? Does the role pivot on the ethnic identity of the characters and performers in a way that prevents them from being seen as more than just the color of their skin and the accent of their speech? And finally, is the vehicle in which it's taking place innovative, eye-opening, horizon-expanding, or does it reduce, repress and restrict? As \"Fish\" was finishing its preview run, a theater-world drama of another color was erupting nearby. The National Asian Artists Project\u200a, \u200aa nonprofit theater company that produces works from the traditional Broadway canon featuring all-Asian casts, had announced its next production would be a big-budget, Asian American adaptation of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Show Boat,\" to be developed and directed by Broadway wunderkind Tommy Tune. The problem, as Asian American actor and blogger Erin Quill immediately called out, is that unlike NAAP's prior projects, which have included shows such as \"Oliver!\" and \"Carousel,\" \"Show Boat\" is set in the Deep South, among the laborers and performers working on and about the Cotton Blossom, a paddleboat theater offering entertainment to audiences up and down the Mississippi. \"This show ... is about the great racial divides within the Deep South\u200a -- divides that are, without question, black and white,\" wrote Quill. \"[Asians] were not 'toting that barge' or 'lifting that bale'. Asian Americans were not recovering from being ripped from their homeland and bound in chains due to the color of their skin. It is not 'our' story to tell.\" The fundamental mission of NAAP and other theatrical companies that cast productions against type is twofold: They seek to showcase overlooked talent and to challenge the racial conventions of the aptly dubbed \"Great White Way,\" disrupting the notion that phenotypic reference points are necessary for a performer to believably portray a role. In that latter coninput, they're exercises designed to highlight the fundamental magic of live theater: Its power to get audiences to suspend disbelief. NAAP's all-Asian \"Show Boat\" would seem to be not very different from the Public Theater's present production of \"Hamilton,\" featuring a multiracial set of American Founding Fathers -- including Puerto Rican author and composer Lin-Manuel Miranda as the titular Hamilton and African American actor Leslie Odom Jr. as his rival, Aaron Burr. And yet, there is a fundamental difference. Having actors of color play characters written for white actors, who are cast in 79% of all Broadway roles (by contrast, Asian Americans and Hispanics are cast in just 3% each and African Americans in 14%), is an act of disruptive defiance. Having actors of color play characters written for other actors of color is shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic at best and at worst, a categorically ill-conceived recipe for insensitivity. Could NAAP have weathered the spectacle of Asian performers speaking in Southern black dialect, performing a plot that's entirely dependent on black history? Could an Asian Steve have cut an Asian Julie's hand, sucking her blood, then declared defiantly to an Asian sheriff that if Julie was a \"mulatto,\" so was he, because he now had \"black blood\" in him? After a contentious town hall, in which numerous other performers of varied race and background expressed their vehement doubts, the Asian American theatrical community, and ultimately NAAP as well, decided it couldn't. The coninput of the show, and the charged climate it would be arriving in, would make its content impossible to swallow. NAAP canceled the production. The costs of the cancellation aren't known, \u200abut they clearly aren't insignificant. But what, by contrast, of \"Fish\"? The reality is that Fabiana (performed by Rosie Perez more or less as Rosie Perez) doesn't stand out as offensive when compared with the rest of the play's characters; for that matter, there's nothing inherently Hispanic about the role, which, if the show had an unlimited run, could easily be recast as Asian, black or white, losing very little in the process. By contrast, nearly all of the rest of the cast fit familiar comedic portrayals of Jewish family members -- most intensely so, the neurotic protagonist, Norman (performed by Larry David himself more or less as Larry David). The truth is, if non-Jews were to put on a production of \"Fish in the Dark,\" it would be difficult not to experience it as anti-Semitic. These are the new and fascinating challenges presented by pop culture in our era of surging diversity, and they're coming fast and furious from every direction. Interesting times and sure to get more interesting still.\n",

After two months of jury selection, a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates was seated Tuesday for the federal death penalty trial of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The all-white panel included 10 men and eight women, 12 of whom will vote on Tsarnaev's fate at the end of a trial expected to wrap up in June. Six will serve as alternates. Opening statements in the case are scheduled for Wednesday. Tsarnaev, 21, faces 30 charges in connection with twin bombings at the finish line of the marathon April 15, 2013. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured. He is also charged in the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days after the bombings. If the jury convicts Tsarnaev, the trial will move on to a second phase to determine his punishment. The only two options available for the jury are life in prison or the death penalty. Judge George O'Toole Jr., prosecutors and Tsarnaev's lawyers questioned prospective jurors individually. Many potential jurors were excused when they said they had already formed an opinion on Tsarnaev's guilt or were morally opposed to the death penalty. Many others were dismissed because of personal connections to the bombings, including people who have friends or family who were near the finish line when the bombs went off or who knew first responders who treated victims. During the jury selection process, Tsarnaev's lawyers tried repeatedly to get the trial moved out of Massachusetts, saying he could not find a fair and impartial jury because of the emotional impact the bombings had in the state. O'Toole rejected three change-of-venue motions, saying the process of carefully questioning jurors to detect bias was successful in finding impartial jurors. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals twice refused to order the trial moved. The jury selection process began in early January when more than 1,350 potential jurors filled out questionnaires on their ties to the attack and their views on the death penalty. To be eligible to serve, candidates needed not to have formed a set opinion of Tsarnaev's guilt and to be willing to consider voting for execution if he was found guilty. Tsarnaev's lawyers last week asserted that the court had violated its own procedures about random selection, reordering jurors as they arrived in a way that reduced the number of black candidates questioned. Tsarnaev's attorneys on Monday offered a possible glimpse into their strategy when they argued that they need to be able to discuss the defendant's relationship with his older brother, Tamerlan, early in the trial. They described 26-year-old Tamerlan, who died following a gun battle with police three days after the bombing, as the driving force behind the attack, saying that his younger brother participated out of submissiveness.

Let's discuss the historic disenfranchisement of your people that has allowed me to prosper.' The campaign was the brainchild of Howard Schultz, 61, the company's boss, who has a track record of speaking out about contentious topics, from gay marriage to gun control. His decision came in response to the escalating racial tension that emerged when grand juries failed to indict white police officers involved in the killings of Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, 43, in Staten Island, New York. Last year, Schultz travelled to Starbucks branches in the cities most affected by racial tension, including Los Angeles, St Louis, Chicago, New York, Oakland and Seattle. Mr Schulz met about 2,000 Starbucks staff on the tour, and made contact with the rest of his 200,000 employees - 40 per cent of whom are from ethnic minority backgrounds - via a video address. 'It's an emotional issue,' he said. 'But it is so vitally important to the country.' Last week, the company ran full-page advertisements in the New York Times and USA Today, highlighting race tensions in the country. The page was black, with the words 'shall we overcome?' in the centre, and the company logo at the bottom. The campaign will continue on Friday, when every copy of USA Today will carry an insert about racism, which will also be stocked at branches of Starbucks. Schultz kicked off the campaign last December with a letter that appeared in TIME magazine. 'Last week, one thing became clear: we cannot continue to come to work every day aware of the difficult and painful experiences facing our nation, and not acknowledge them, together, as a company,' he wrote. 'Indeed, despite the raw emotion around the events and their underlying racial issues, we at Starbucks should be willing to talk about them.' Schultz has a track record of using his public profile to highlight issues close to his heart. In 2013, he wrote an open letter requesting customers to leave their guns at home when they visited his stores, even in states where they can be carried legally. 'We believe guns and weapons should not be part of the Starbucks experience,' he said. He also spearheaded a petition to end federal shutdown in the same year, and launched a scheme to boost job creation in the U.S. by selling bracelets in its caf\u00e9s in 2011. Starbucks is also intending to employ 10,000 former members of the armed forces and their partners over five years. It is not known whether Starbucks is considering pulling the RaceTogether campaign. Traditionally, those who oppose Schultz' views get short shrift: in 2013, when an investor said that the company's open support for gay marriage was harming sales, Schultz responded by suggesting that he sell his shares.\n",

A canoeist with a rare heart condition has been pronounced clinically dead 36 times in a year. Sarah Brautigam, 21, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, has been close to death dozens of times due to an affliction which makes her heart stop beating - and said that each time her hearing is the last thing to go. The former Great Britain canoeist saw her life turned upside down four years ago when she was diagnosed with a condition called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Miss Brautigam, who wants to be a burlesque dancer, has rapid palpitations that cause her heart to stop beating and her blood pressure to fall to what doctors record as clinically dead. On occasion she has to wait up to 30 minutes for her heart to refill with blood. She also suffers joint hypermobility syndrome, which means her joints are more prone to injury and dislocation. The two combined resulted in her visiting A&E 64 times in the same year. But Miss Brautigam insisted that she is determined not to let the conditions hold her back. She said: \u2018There are signs before it happens - I\u2019ll feel dizzy or sick and really tired and then I feel as though I\u2019m falling asleep. \u2018I can hear everything around me and feel as though I\u2019m trying to shout but nothing is coming out. They say when you die your hearing is the last thing to go and that\u2019s been my experience. \u2018After an attack I\u2019ll wake up and my chest will be killing and I\u2019m really tired.\u2019 Miss Brautigam said each time her heart stops medics have to inflict pain on her to shock her into coming back to life. She cannot be given CPR until her heart has re-filled with blood. She said: \u2018When it happens paramedics try and do anything to inflict pain to try and shock me into coming back to life. 'A lot of the time I\u2019ll wake up with big bruises. On one occasion they ripped an acrylic nail off but that still didn\u2019t make me flinch.\u2019 In hospital: A combination of her postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and joint hypermobility syndrome have resulted in Miss Brautiga visiting A&E 64 times in the same year . Miss Brautigam was a canoeing fanatic who made it to the GB squad and was training six days a week when she was diagnosed and her dreams 'came crashing down'. She was told she could no longer take part in the sport and her dreams of joining the Navy were also left in tatters. Even getting a job and driving were affected by the condition. Miss Brautigam added: \u2018I had 10 years of being out every weekend canoeing and being so active and it all came crashing down. I piled on the weight because I couldn\u2019t exercise and was really upset. \u2018I can\u2019t even work at the minute because I would need a job that could be very flexible. Then I was told I couldn\u2019t drive, it was like everything was being taken away from me. Medical device: Miss Brautigam is pictured with the remote she has to trigger when she has an episode . Helping hand: A previous implantable loop recorder which saved 21-year-old Miss Brautigam from death . \u2018I lost a lot of friends, in fact I only have one friend from school. Everyone seemed to be too busy with their own lives to bother with me when I was diagnosed.\u2019 Miss Brautigam was pronounced clinically dead 36 times in 2012 but has since began burlesque chair dancing, which she said \u2018has given me a new lease of life\u2019. She added: \u2018I made so many friends and everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to do anything like his with my illness but everyone looks out for me at the class. I\u2019ve only passed out once since I started. 'I\u2019m determined not to let this beat me, joining the group has given me a life back. \u2018It might kill me but at least I\u2019d die happy - for me. I\u2019d rather live to the full rather than live longer and be wrapped up in cotton wool \u2013 it\u2019s all about quality of life.'\n",

The Foxes are seven points from safety in the Barclays Premier League and have lost five of their last six top-flight games. They host the Tigers on Saturday and manager Pearson insists they are out to prove the doubters wrong. Nigel Pearson (centre) watches training unfold on Thursday as Leicester prepare for their clash against Hull . Pearson insists he and his squad believe they can still avoid relegation from the Premier League this season . He said: 'We still have a strong belief in our ability to stay up this season. 'Whether other people share it is not that important at the moment. In house there is a feeling we can do it. 'Saturday is a game both sides want to win. But Hull may be happier with the draw than us. We certainly need to win the game.' The Foxes have not won in the league since beating Aston Villa 1-0 in January but Pearson thinks one victory could spark a run of results. 'That is something we keep very much in our minds because we do have that belief,' said the manager, who spent just over a year as Hull boss before returning to Leicester in 2011.

'Personally I don't care about the occasion,' Upson told the club's official site. 'Whether it's a World Cup final or a Premier League game it's the same focus and the same attitude, the grass is green and the ball is round. 'I'd like to use that as extra motivation. I like to think I'm committed to do my best, whether I'm playing for the Under-21s or the first team.' Leicester have not played since their 2-0 defeat at Manchester City and with a 10-day break between games Upson hopes they have recharged. Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel could return to face Hull after recovering from a broken foot . 'I think it can be quite a difficult, 10 days' said the 34-year-old. 'You can look at it in two ways, it's just important that the players are looking at it in the right way - as an opportunity to prepare for this game. 'It's a difficult period and a lot of thought has to go into training and how much you do focusing on one game, and how much is for fitness and how much is for getting the players in the right frame of mind. 'All those things have to have the right balance and I think it's important to get into the right frame of mind.'\n",

        "input": "(CNN)Today, Katie Meyler might be meeting with Google executives or maybe giving a talk at the United Nations about girls' education, poverty or Ebola. But just a few months ago, she was on the front lines fighting the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. \"I think anybody that has any feelings for the countries in West Africa that were hit was feeling helpless,\" Meyler said. Meyler had spent the last nine years of her life in Liberia setting up the More Than Me Academy, a tuition-free school for at-risk Liberian girls. While she was on summer break last year, visiting her family in the United States, her mind kept going back to Liberia and the Ebola outbreak. She couldn't sit idle as her neighbors, friends and students were fighting for their lives. Meyler, who is not a medical professional, flew back to the front lines of a global epidemic, the last place most Americans wanted to be during the outbreak. Back in Liberia, Meyler quickly realized that fighting Ebola would be more complicated than administering medical care. With dozens of aid organizations descending on the country, few of them had a history or relationship with it. Meyler saw an opportunity to leverage her relationship with the community of West Point, the slum in which her school is located. Her ability to speak the Liberian-English dialect facilitated logistics. \"The people knew what was needed,\" Meyler said. \"They knew what to do. They just didn't have the resources.\" Her organization met with community leaders and they decided more ambulances were needed. In some instances, it took up to four days for an ambulance to show up. Meyler was able to bring in four ambulances and coordinate with the fathers of her students, who responded to calls by driving the ambulances. Meyler and community leaders identified what was most needed and then came up with steps to meet those needs, said Meyler. Next, they formed a group of active case finders, people who would go door to door in the poorest parts of West Point, looking for anyone that had fallen ill. Once a sick person was identified, a nursing team was dispatched to determine the next steps and treatment. The hardest part for Meyler, who often describes herself as a \"big kid,\" was seeing children abandoned and orphaned by Ebola. According to UNICEF, 16,600 children have lost one or both parents to Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Meyler's school turned one of its guesthouses into Hope 21, a place to quarantine children suspected of having the Ebola virus. During the good times and the bad, Meyler took to Instagram to post photos and her thoughts. For nearly 100,000 of her followers, her Instagram became a window into the battle against Ebola. Social media have played a major role in the success of Meyler's organization since its inception nine years ago. To launch More Than Me, she did everything from fund-raising on MySpace to participating in clinical research studies. In 2012, the group was awarded a $1 million grant from JPMorgan Chase's American Giving Awards, after Facebook users voted for the organization. Long before Meyler became an Ebola fighter, she grew up in a working-class family from New Jersey. She always felt underprivileged, until she became involved in community service. That's when she decided to dedicate her life to helping people. Meyler has since won a number of awards and has been recognized for her work in Liberia. She was one of the Ebola fighters honored as Time's Person of the Year in 2014. \"I'm not the same person that I was before Ebola hit,\" said Meyler. Reflecting on the months she spent fighting Ebola, she said, \"The people on the front lines that were risking their lives were the people who were fighting for their own lives, who were fighting for their children's lives.\" Now it is about learning to live with Ebola, said Meyler, whose school has dozens of students who are Ebola orphans and survivors. Meyler continues to focus on girls and education in Liberia, meeting with tech giants and innovative education labs to come up with ways to better serve her students at More Than Me.\n",

        "input": "Cassie Newnham (pictured) insisted on a prenup before tying the knot with boyfriend of four years Brendon . Wedding dresses and venues might top the list of internet searches for most brides-to-be, but not for Cassie Newnham. When her boyfriend of four years popped the question, the 33-year-old wasted no time Googling prenuptial agreements instead. Despite being head over heels in love with Brendon, 38, Cassie, who lives in London and is originally from South Africa, had spent years working hard to save for her future. And as her heart raced with wedding plans, her head told her to protect her assets. 'People think of a prenup as something you put in place in case you get divorced but it's actually a great way to safeguard your assets,' account manager Cassie said. She got engaged to Brendon in February 2013, when he went down on one knee during a trip to Cape Town for a friend's wedding. She continued: 'If you take life insurance out you're not protecting yourself from death, you're just insuring yourself in case.' Like Beyonce and Nicole Kidman \u2013 who are both reported to have prenuptial agreements \u2013 getting her man to sign on the dotted line before walking up the aisle was non-negotiable for Cassie. She thinks Cheryl Fernandez-Versini was wrong for not instigating one before her whirlwind wedding to Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July 2014. 'You always think \"it will never happen to me\" but you just don't know,' Cassie said. She continued: 'Quite a lot of our friends have prenups in place. If you've put money into property or built up your own career or company, that's something you should safeguard.' Cassie and Brendon's prenup was signed a month before their wedding day in Cape Town in January 2014 (Pictured: The couple at their wedding) If the Brendon and Cassie (pictured) split up each will keep all of the assets they acquired before their marriage took place . So as Cassie and Brendon planned their big white wedding in front of 98 guests in Cape Town in January 2014, they were also busy negotiating how they would split their future possessions. 'We both always thought prenuptial agreements were a good idea, so we were both in agreement we should get one done, says Cassie, who is expecting the couple's first child at the end of March. She continued: 'Neither of us felt awkward about it at all.' 'As well as the house we bought together before we got married, I have a property in South Africa left to me by my dad, and Brendon already had a property too. 'In addition, we both had savings.' Beyonce (left) has been reported saying a prenup is 'smart', Catherine Zeta-Jones (centre) is said to have one and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini (right) reportedly refused to sign one before her marriage to Jean-Bernard . The couple used online law firm Rocket Lawyer to draw up an official agreement and Cassie thinks more brides-to-be should consider doing the same. A prenup is a legally binding contract entered into before marriage . It protects people from losing money and assets . It commonly includes provisions for divisions or property or spousal support in the event of divorce . A prenuptial agreement isn't legally binding in the UK but will be taken into account during a divorce hearing . It is also possible to have a postnuptial agreement after the marriage ceremony has taken place. She said: 'You can tailor your prenup to whatever you want it to be, and it also protects you from debt. 'People think it's a legal agreement and you need a lawyer but it's really simple and cheap. 'We entered our details, declared what our savings and assets are and it gets checked by a lawyer. 'It cost us \u00a325 and took about 20 minutes.' In the event of divorce, Cassie and Brendon have agreed to split all the earnings accumulated during their marriage by 50 per cent. The earnings accumulated before are their own. 'Prenuptial agreements are becoming more and more common these days \u2013 it's like taking out insurance. 'It hasn't impacted our relationship and we don't talk about it anymore. 'It's a good thing to have in place.' Keith Urban will allegedly receive $640,000 (\u00a3429k) for every year he is married to Nicole Kidman if they split . Beyonce and Jay-Z: Beyonce reportedly gets $5m (\u00a33,349,634) with each child she bears and would receive $1m (\u00a3669,926) for every year the pair were married if they divorce. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban: Keith will allegedly receive $640,000 (\u00a3428,753) for every year the couple is married \u2013 unless he uses drugs . Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas: It's reported that if the Hollywood couple split she will receive $2.8m (\u00a31,875,669) for every year of the marriage, and if he cheats on her she gets a $5m 'bonus'.\n",
