Ron: I might be lacking the context here Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork. Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year. Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person. Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there? Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really. Jessie: so what do we get from it really? Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp. Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other> Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually Michaela: I recall two as well Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort. Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it Michaela: Steve? Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now Michaela: Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. Is Monday after the meeting ok for you all? Steve: yup, I can stay a bit longer Jessie: Fine by me Ron: as well\n",

Are you having fun? Matty: Sounds interesting I've gotta say. Particularly the bacteria stuff! I've been on a walk today so quite tired from that. And I'm enjoying uni yeah! Very very busy. Starting dissertation stuff soon and had a lot of work for essays Ella: Did you take any photos whilst on your walk? :D So... what does your dissertation stuff look like? Are you in any Uni groups? Matty: Got some yeah :) posted one to Facebook. Mine is looking like geography and politics related. Not sure about uni groups? What's your dissertation on if you have to do one? Ella: We don't really have dissertations... at the end of my third year I'll be writing my degree, so that will be like a slightly longer lab report :) Geography and politics - hmmm... that's a pretty wide topic, I mean, you could talk about Global warming etc. right? Matty: Aah ok. So the long report is a big part of your degree and counts a lot towards it? Matty: And it's very wide the topic. Can talk about that yes, can also do social and cultural stuff too in there Ella: Yeah, basically my grades and my report make up my degree :) Social and cultural stuff... like what? Matty: Aaah cool :D I have exams too which make mine up haha. Lucky you Matty: And stuff like social separation and classes and how everything plays into each other and culture is like heritage and what matters to different people Ella: I meant grades from exams, so I don't know if I'm really that lucky :P That's actually really interesting! So how do you prepare for this? Do you get to interview people? Matty: Oh right haha. And I have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. What kind of things do you do in the lab? Ella: Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing Microbiology, or study particular fragments of DNA if they're doing Genetics Ella: It really depends on what you're studying - Biology has a pretty large spectrum, afterall :)\n",

Barry: It's only a shame about the POV... Patricia: You don't like first-person? Barry: Well, I guess it's okay at times but I'd prefer over-the-shoulder.
